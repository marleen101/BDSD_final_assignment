&gt;(2) that we do not know whether humans are to blame for global warming?

&gt;(3) that global warming will not have any severe consequences?

&gt;(4) that we cannot stop global warming?

&gt;Not one of these answers is correct. None of these conclusions would be logical. Why not?


....however 4) is PRACTICALLY correct. Especially if you change it to: ""We cannot stop global warming from serverly impacting our current way of life.""

If you change it to ""We can slightly improve the possibility of continued human existence by radically altering our current way of life under mass industrialised capitalism"" it becomes more true.

Let's face it - we all know our addiction to production, and capitalism's desire to keep the (possible) toxic effects of production out of the consumers view, is what perpetuates global warming.

There should be a government website that allows you to look up products by brand and find out the processes, origins, excesses and environmental damage along the way.

Yes, there was a paper/study, suggesting that the PETM happened within 13 years, although I think it was disproven/highly unexplainable, even when it comes to methane hydrates(correct me here, if I am wrong). I know that not every scientist has these worries, but taking a review from Peter carter, we might be adding 3-4 ppm of CO2 per year into the atmosphere. Going hypothetical here, we would add 400 ppm to ppm to our current CO2 concentration(415ppm, If I am sure), so that's 815 ppm. That doesn't even consider feedbacks and so on. Only within a hundred years. Then, consider past climate: Creatacous was 8C warmer then today, at 800-1,200 ppm or even more, as certain sources claim. Keeping that in mind, we should worry about the rate of change. If we jump to 1,000 ppm within 200 years(slightly more), then there is little to no evidence of such a thing happening in earths past.

The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), one of the best-studied paleoclimatic intervals, offers a prime opportunity to investigate how the climate system responds to changes in greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the cryosphere. Previous work has sought to constrain the magnitude and pattern of glacial cooling from paleothermometers, but the uneven distribution of the proxies, as well as their uncertainties, has challenged the construction of a full-field view of the LGM climate state. Here, we combine a large collection of geochemical proxies for sea-surface temperature with an isotope-enabled climate model ensemble to produce a field reconstruction of LGM temperatures using data assimilation. The reconstruction is validated with withheld proxies as well as independent ice core and speleothem d18O measurements. Our assimilated product provides a precise constraint on global mean LGM cooling of -5.9˚C (-6.3 – -5.6˚C, 95% CI). Given assumptions concerning the radiative forcing of GHGs, ice sheets, and aerosols, this cooling **translates to an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 3.2˚C (2.2 – 4.3˚C, 95% CI), a value that is higher than previous estimates and but consistent with the traditional consensus range of 2 – 4.5˚C.**","GlobalClimateChange",2019-12-29 21:07:27,"ehbhnk","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,8,NA,"Study (preprint) | Glacial cooling and climate sensitivity revisited",1,8,0,2019-12-29 21:03:50,2019-12-29

"fcavycr",1,"***5. Comparison of the records***

Paleointensity and isotope data can be directly compared in the depth scale without any synchronization or uncertainty in age since they come from the same sedimentary record. The only necessary processing was a linear interpolation to the same depth that was achieved downsampling the higher resolution paleointensity data (Fig. 1). To test the possible correlation, we initially made scatter plots of B* and δ18O (Fig. 4) and performed a simple linear regression between paleomagnetic field intensity (as a proxy for GCR flux) and oxygen isotopes finding no significant correlations (R = 0.044 and R = 0.043 for benthic and planktonic data, respectively).

[Fig. 4.](https://i.imgur.com/1JUjJCr.jpg) Scatter plot of B* versus the benthonic and planktonic δ18O after standardization; no correlation is apparent from the plot.

We further test the independence of B* and benthic δ18O, which reflects the glacial history over the surveyed time interval, using a 3 × 3 contingency table (Table 1). We applied a non-parametric Fisher's exact test that indicated data independency at the 95% confidence level.

Table 1. The contingency table of the categorized B* and benthic δ18O data, has been positively tested for independency at the confidence level of 95% using a Fisher's exact test. The δ18O data were linearly detrended before computation of categories.




    | δ18O &lt; −σ	| -σ &lt; δ18O &lt; σ | δ18O &gt; σ |

-σ &lt; B* &lt; σ | 52 | 83 | 67 | Tot = 202
B* &gt; σ | 39 | 58 | 44 | Tot = 141
 | Tot = 139 | Tot = 192 | Tot = 147 | N = 478

More refined analysis were performed using spectral methods. We computed the spectral power and coherence between benthic δ18O and B* using the multi-taper method (Mann and Lees, 1996). Gaps in the δ18O and B* time series were filled using the algorithm described by (Kondrashov and Ghil, 2006). The power spectra of benthic δ18O and B* are compared in Fig. 5a, the spectral coherence in Fig. 5b. Results suggest that statistically significant correlation exist for a very limited range of frequency bands (Fig. 5b), which represent the 8% and 12% of the total variance of δ18O and B*, respectively. The number of frequencies that exceed the 95% confidence level (15 out of 257 frequencies) and the 99% confidence levels (5 out of 257 frequencies) are only slightly higher than the 12 and 2.5 expected, respectively, from statistical fluctuations hinting to an almost complete independency of the two time series.

(LE = long eccentricity; SE = short eccentricity; O = obliquity; P = Precession of the equinox). Power spectra and coherence have been computed in the core-depth scale rather then time scale (Wade and Pälike, 2004). b and c) Cross-spectral analysis (spectral coherence and phase) of paleointensity versus oxygen isotope data benthic foraminifera. Both paleointensity and isotopic data were re-sampled at evenly space intervals of about 11 cm, power spectra and coherence was calculated using the MTM coherence method of (Mann and Lees, 1996) with 3 tapers and bandwidth parameter p = 2. Dashed and continuous horizontal lines represent the 95% and 99% confidence limits, respectively for non-zero coherency, gray bands marks frequencies at which significant coherence can be found.

Inspection of the phase angle (Fig. 5c) shows that significant correlating frequencies have a phase-lags corresponding or close to zero, with the exception of the single peak at 3.25 m^(−1).

However, the GCR-climate model predicts higher GCR fluxes, thus lower geomagnetic field intensity, favoring glacial conditions (Shaviv and Veizer, 2003), which would imply an anti-correlation with a phase angle of 180° between geomagnetic field intensity and oxygen isotopes. Hence, even the statistically significant correlation found in limited frequency bands does not support the hypothesis of a control of GCR on global climate on the investigated time scale (10^3–5 yr).

Similar conclusions can be extracted from the analysis of Wavelet Coherence of the δ18O and B* time series (Fig. 6), which evidences higher coherence on the same frequencies/periods as MTM, although a lower of components exceeds the 95% confidence limit. Importantly, Wavelet Coherence better details the intermittant nature of high coherence intervals for any periodicity and the phase relationships through the record. It is worth noticing that the only interval where the expected 180° antiphase is observed is confined to a short interval at ~178 mcd at a wavelength of 150 cm.

***6. Conclusions***

Comparison of the geomagnetic paleointensity and both benthic and planktonic foraminiferal d18O (as a proxy for paleoclimate) from the Oligocene ODP Site 1218 (Equatorial Pacific) show no significant correlation, suggesting a substantial independence of the two records. The analysis of phase-lag suggests that even the marginal correlation found by spectral coherence analysis cannot be ascribed to the putative GCR interaction with climate. Our results suggest that the hypothetical link between the geomagnetic field intensity and climate predicted by the CFR hypothesis is absent or below the threshold of the sensitivity and accuracy of the proxy - a few tenths of °C for δ18O considering analytical precision – hence providing evidences against a long-term (10^(3)–10^5 yrs) control of GCR on global climate.

***3. Paleointensity record***

For the purpose of this study we have computed the relative paleointensity (B*) of geomagnetic field in 43 u-channel samples (continuous subsamples of split cores) from ODP Site 1218. The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was normalized by isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). ARM was imparted to the u-channel samples with a 0.05 mT bias field and a 100 mT peak alternating field. IRM was induced with a 100 mT impulse field. Both ARM and IRM were subsequently measured at 1 cm intervals and subjected to progressive alternating field demagnetization. The measurement spacing of 1 cm, and AF demagnetization peak fields were chosen accordingly to those previously used for the NRM demagnetization (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005).

Uniform magnetic properties were checked by inspecting the variability of ARM and IRM. Histograms with the distributions of ARM and IRM intensity, after a 20 mT AF demagnetization (Fig. 2a) show that 95% of samples are within a variability factor of about 4.2 for ARM and 5.8 for IRM, well below the limit suggested by (King et al., 1983). However, we adopted a conservative approach considering less reliable the samples comprised in the 0.25% tails of IRM and ARM intensity distributions and marked them appropriately in the paleointensity record. A further quality checks for the uniform magnetic grain-size along the sedimentary sequence was checked by the IRM/ARM ratio, which is remarkably constant along the whole sequence (Fig. 2b).

[Fig. 2.](https://i.imgur.com/FMcmdmI.jpg) a) Histograms of ARM and IRM intensity after AF demagnetization at 20 mT. Gray bands on the sides of the histograms indicate the 2.5% tails of the distributions, which have been considered as less reliable and removed from the record. b) The diagram of ARM vs IRM after AF demagnetization at 20 mT shows the constant magnetic properties of the sediments.

ARM and IRM were subject to stepwise alternating field demagnetization using the identical peak fields used in NRM demagnetization, then B* was computed by fitting a straight line between the NRM intensity and the normalizer intensity (Fig. 3) following an approach similar to that of the Arai plots (Tauxe, 1993). The angular coefficient of the best-fit line is taken as our best estimates B*.

[Fig. 3.](https://i.imgur.com/LlSZAFL.jpg) Pseudo-Arai plot for typical samples of the studied sections of ODP Site 1218. Sample code (e.g. 1218B-16H-2-69.0) follows the standard IODP labelling, i.e. site and hole-core-section-depth. A large correlation coefficient for the best-fit line between NRM and ARM is generally found in the for AF demagnetization field larger than 20 mT. The small offset of the best-fit line is interpreted as a consequence of a spurious magnetization acquired during NRM demagnetization, as described by (Lanci et al., 2005). Smaller dots represent the demagnetization path; larger dots represent NRM values.

and the correlation coefficient R is used to evaluate the goodness of fit, thus the quality of the data. To avoid an unwanted influence of soft component in the NRM, B* was calculated from the same alternating field demagnetization steps used for calculation of the ChRM directions, which ranges between 20 mT and 80 mT. We finally choose to use the ARM as normalizer for the relative paleointensity (B*) record, although very similar results were obtained using IRM, as shown in Fig. 1. The statistical independence between the normalizer (ARM) and B* have been positively tested at the 95% confidence level using a Fisher exact test (Agresti, 2007), on a 3 × 3 contingency table to ensure that the paleointensity record is not significantly influenced by lithology. The trend and the relative variability of our paleomagnetic results are comparable with the coeval relative paleointensity record from ODP Site 522 (Tauxe and Hartl, 1997).

The absolute value of the geomagnetic dipole moment is not essential to evaluate the variation of the shielding effect from GCR fluxes because of the linear dependence of rigidity cuf-off of cosmic rays and dipole moment (Störmer, 1930). However, we have rescaled the values of B* by dividing their average values by the 0.3–30 Ma average geomagnetic moment (Selkin and Tauxe, 2000) Compared to the data compilation (Guyodo and Valet, 1999) from the last 800 kyr (Sint800) when large climate changes occurred across glacial-interglacial cycles, the variability of the Oligocene rescaled paleointensity record is slightly larger (σ = 4.4 × 10^22 A m^2 compared to σ = 2.6 × 10^22 A m^2 for Sint800).

***4. Paleoclimatic record***

Cenozoic climate revealed by multiple stable isotope (δ18O and δ13C) records from oceanic sediments shows considerable variability reflecting longer-term (106 yr) and short-term (104–105 yr) global fluctuations of ice-volume and/or deep-sea temperatures, and global carbon budget (Zachos et al., 2001). A detailed record of climate variability during the Early Oligocene is available from deep-sea sediments recovered with Equatorial Pacific ODP Leg 199. The oxygen stable isotope record from the continuous sedimentary sequence of Site 1218 suggests that major glacial episodes, occurred at 29.16, 27.91, and 26.76 Ma (Wade and Pälike, 2004), providing evidence for a global climate change signal well above the “noise” introduced by potential problems related to the sensitivity and laboratory accuracy of the proxy. Large (50–65 m) glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations corresponds to these events (Kominz and Pekar, 2001). Remarkable fluctuations in the Carbon isotope record suggest that major changes in the global carbon cycle were associated to these episodes of climate change (Wade and Pälike, 2004). The benthic foraminiferal δ18O record from Site 1218 is comparable with data obtained elsewhere (e.g. Zachos et al., 2001) implying that observed changes reflect a global signal.

The stable isotope stratigraphy provided by (Wade and Pälike, 2004) for the stratigraphic interval between magnetochrons C9n and C11n.2n corresponding to ~26.4 Ma–30 Ma based on astrochronology, represents the most detailed record of both short- (&lt;0.5 Myr) and long-term (2–3 Myr) climate change during the Oligocene (Lear et al., 2004; Wade and Pälike, 2004). ODP Site 1218 offers the possibility of directly comparing a high resolution record of relative geomagnetic paleointensity fluctuations, that we use as proxy for changes in GCR flux, with such a record of global climate changes.

***Abstract***

Changes in Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) flux have been proposed by some as the main factor controlling Earth's climate. This hypothesis, which invokes enhanced formation of low clouds due to ionization of atmospheric aerosol by GCR flux as a control mechanism, implies that climate sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 levels is overestimated. Here we propose to test this conjecture by comparing a deep-time 3.6 million year–long (~30–26.4 million years ago) record of global climate changes with a proxy record of geomagnetic paleointensity fluctuations. At the time scale adopted for this study, the geomagnetic field intensity is the major controller of GCR reaching the Earth. We compare the records of paleointensity, as a proxy for GCR flux fluctuations, and a record of global climate showing that they are substantially independent. We conclude that, the putative role of GCR flux as a cause for medium to long term (10^(3–5) yr) changes in Earth's climate is not supported by evidence.

***1. Introduction***

Several studies have proposed a possible influence of variations in the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) flux on Earth's climate, on the basis of an observed correlation between the amount of (GCR) flux reaching the atmosphere and average cloud cover on decadal (Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 1997; Marsh and Svensmark, 2000) and weekly timescales (Svensmark et al., 2016). Yet, other studies found no evidence for such a GCR-cloud correlation and discussed the possibility that methodological differences lead to different results (e.g. Laken et al., 2012).

More recently, experimental testing of the direct influence of GCR on cloud formation through the CLOUD experiment provided evidence for a very weak direct influence of GCR on cloud formation (Pierce, 2017). Although that study did not entirely excluding the possibility of indirect mechanisms, i.e. through a control on the global electric circuit (Tinsley and Zhou, 2015) and/or on the concentration of ozone close to the tropopause (Krivolutsky and Repnev, 2012). Indeed, different authors have proposed a connection between periods of higher solar activity – thus lower GCR flux –, and warmer climate intervals over periods of 100–200 kyr (Sharma, 2002; Christl et al., 2004) and during the last millennia (Usoskin et al., 2005) suggesting that effects induced by cosmic rays may affect longer-term changes in terrestrial climate.

On longer time scale (10^(4–6) yr), GCR variations are influenced by processes external to the heliosphere such as interstellar environment changes (Yabushita and Allen, 1998) or galaxy spiral arm crossings (Shaviv, 2003). On these grounds, a correlation between cosmic ray fluxes, inferred from measurements in meteorites, and occurrence of glacial ages in the last 150 Myr, has been claimed as an unambiguous evidence for a control of GCR on climate (Shaviv, 2002; Shaviv, 2003). However, flaws in the handling of different physical data have been evidenced by (Laut, 2003).

One way to indirectly test their potential effect of on climate is by comparing lateral or temporal variations in the intensity of the geomagnetic field to atmospheric and/or climate conditions. The geomagnetic field, in fact, has a considerable shielding effect on GCR (Walker, 1979; Smart and Shea, 2009). In the modern era, the cut-off rigidity (particle momentum per unit charge) varies from 0 through slightly &lt;17 GV for particle vertical arrival direction (see also www.nmdb.eu).

A decrease in the geomagnetic field intensity of 10–20% of the present day value would cause an increase of the GCR flux on our planet by 90–70% (Wagner et al., 2000). For comparison, the integral GCR flux at 1 au varies by a factor of four, ranging from 4000 particles m-2 sr-1 s-1 at solar minimum through 1000 particles m-2 sr-1 s-1 at solar maximum (11-year solar cycle; Potgieter, 2013; Armano et al., 2019). During periods of negative solar polarity, when the global solar magnetic field (GSMF) lines of force emanate from the Sun South Pole, the flux of positively charged particles appears more modulated, up to 40% at 100 MeV n-1 at solar minimum, with respect to epochs of positive solar polarity (Boella et al., 2001; Grimani, 2004, Grimani, 2007). The same polarity of the Sun is observed every 22 years, on average.

The passage of interplanetary large-scale structures, such as high-speed solar wind streams and interplanetary counterparts of coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), cause short-term recurrent and non-recurrent GCR flux variations (of typical duration of &lt;1 month; Cane, 2000, Richardson, 2004). A particle detector flown on the European Space Agency LISA Pathfinder mission between 2016 and 2017 allowed for monitoring the percentage change of the GCR proton (p) and helium (He) count rate (proportional to p and He fluxes) during this period of time (Armano et al., 2018 and references therein) and found that p and He nuclei constitute 98% of the cosmic-ray bulk in particle numbers to the total number. In space and above 70 MeV n-1, the GCR flux presents recurrent percent variations with respect to individual monthly averaged values of up to ± 7%. These variations show the same periodicities of the solar rotation period and higher harmonics.

Forbush decreases, generated by the passage of ICMEs, account for non-recurrent sudden drops of the GCR flux ranging between a few% and tens of %. Neutron monitors (NMs) have continuously monitored secondary particle final products of primary cosmic-ray (with energies &gt;500 MeV n-1) interactions in the atmosphere (Cane, 2000 and references therein) since the early 1950s. In order to infer the GCR fluxes at the top of the atmosphere from NM data, nucleon observations and secondary particle production in the atmosphere are combined in the NM yield functions. NMs allow for a direct measurement of the GCR flux above effective energies (Ec) only. At energies &gt; Ec the NM counting rate is proportional to the GCR integral flux incident at the top of the atmosphere. Ec range from 11 to 12 GeV for polar NMs through &gt;30 GeV for equatorial stations (Gil et al., 2017). NM observations show sudden decreases in intensity &gt;10% only during strong Forbush decreases (see for instance Cane, 2000).

From these observations, it can be concluded that at low latitudes, where insolation is maximal, the shielding effect of the geomagnetic field overcomes the role of both short and long-term GCR flux variations that result effective below 10 GeV-1 n. Consequently, in geological archives, if a (detectable) GCR effect on climate exists, evidence should be found by comparing paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic intensity records (e.g. Kitaba et al., 2017). Here we test this hypothesis by comparing a 3.6 Myr-long record of oxygen stable isotope, − a well established proxy for global paleoclimate change (e.g. Zachos et al., 2001) -, and Earth magnetic field paleointensity - as a proxy for the shielding effect - from ODP Leg 199 Site 1218 (Equatorial Pacific) during the early Oligocene (~26.4–30 Ma). Paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic records are derived from the same sedimentary archive and can thus be compared directly without the otherwise unavoidable uncertainty in the age model.

***2. Material and methods***

ODP Site 1218 (8°53.378′N, 135°22.00′W, water depth of 4811 m) is located in the central tropical Pacific (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002). The Pleistocene and Miocene sedimentary sequence at ODP Site 1218 comprise two main sedimentary units. The upper 59 m consists of a Pleistocene to Middle Miocene brown clay unit with some nannofossils and occasional barren intervals (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002). This upper clay unit is mostly made of wind-blown dust, clays, and radiolarians, some of which were reworked from older outcropping sediment. Below this brown clay unit, from 59 to 242 m composite depth, the section comprises nannofossils ooze and chalk of Lower Miocene–Oligocene age, which are the sediments examined in this study.

The complete magnetic stratigraphy, including rock magnetic analysis, of sediments from ODP Site 1218 were reported in (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005). Relative paleointensities of the Miocene-Oligocene section (from 50 to 140 mcd) of site ODP 1218 were studied by Channell and Lanci (2014) who have shown detailed rock-magnetic analysis. The reliability of Miocene-Oligocene paleointensity from Site 1218 was tested by comparison with coeval sedimentary record from ODP Site 1090 and IODP Site U1334 (Channell and Lanci, 2014). The three records from equatorial Pacific to South Atlantic gave very similar results implying that observed relative paleointensity represent a global signal.

The portion of ODP Site 1218 examined in this paper range from about 130 m to 190 m core depth. The sediments are Oligocene in age and have magnetic properties virtually identical to the overlying Miocene sediments and share the same reliability of paleomagnetic measurements.

At ODP Site 1218, the magnetostratigraphy (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005) has successfully identified polarity reversals from the lower Pliocene to the lower and could be unambiguously correlated with the reference Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale providing a precise dating of the sequence. The studied portion of ODP Site 1218 is comprised within the top of chron C9n and the bottom of chron C11n.2n with only minor gaps due to sampling problems or core recovery breaches ([Fig. 1](https://i.imgur.com/iqjQr4M.jpg)).","GlobalClimateChange",2019-12-28 23:36:17,"eg71ek","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"Study (open access) | Evidence against a long-term control on Earth climate by Galactic Cosmic Ray Flux",0.82,10,0,2019-12-27 05:37:15,2019-12-27

With all due respect, I don't see it that way. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but as I see it, while most people _say_ that they care--whether because of social pressure or to feel better about themselves--most of them don't; don't get me wrong, a lot of them _do_ care, but not the majority (in a similar way that most people pay lip-serious to 'being yourself' when in actuality, anyone who fallows that advice is seen as a freak).

**Significance**

Emissions from the fossil fuel industry are one of the major sources of atmospheric methane. Gas leakages due to accidents in the oil and gas sector can release large amounts of methane within short periods of time. Although these emissions are very challenging to monitor, satellite measurement platforms offer a promising approach by regularly scanning the entire globe. This study demonstrates this capability of satellite measurements by reporting atmospheric measurements of methane emission from a natural gas well blowout in Ohio in 2018. Assuming a constant emission rate during the whole event, we find the total methane emission from the 20-d blowout to be equivalent to a substantial fraction of the annual total anthropogenic emission of several European countries.

**Abstract**

Methane emissions due to accidents in the oil and natural gas sector are very challenging to monitor, and hence are seldom considered in emission inventories and reporting. One of the main reasons is the lack of measurements during such events. Here we report the detection of large methane emissions from a gas well blowout in Ohio during February to March 2018 in the total column methane measurements from the spaceborne Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). From these data, we derive a methane emission rate of 120 ± 32 metric tons per hour. This hourly emission rate is twice that of the widely reported Aliso Canyon event in California in 2015. Assuming the detected emission represents the average rate for the 20-d blowout period, we find the total methane emission from the well blowout is comparable to one-quarter of the entire state of Ohio’s reported annual oil and natural gas methane emission, or, alternatively, a substantial fraction of the annual anthropogenic methane emissions from several European countries. Our work demonstrates the strength and effectiveness of routine satellite measurements in detecting and quantifying greenhouse gas emission from unpredictable events. In this specific case, the magnitude of a relatively unknown yet extremely large accidental leakage was revealed using measurements of TROPOMI in its routine global survey, providing quantitative assessment of associated methane emissions.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-12-17 23:29:46,"ec3zbg","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,6,NA,"Exxon well blowout caused 'extreme' methane leak",0.88,6,0,2019-12-17 23:28:29,2019-12-17

**Abstract**

The Antarctic ice sheet has been losing mass over past decades through the accelerated flow of its glaciers, conditioned by ocean temperature and bed topography. Glaciers retreating along retrograde slopes (that is, the bed elevation drops in the inland direction) are potentially unstable, while subglacial ridges slow down the glacial retreat. Despite major advances in the mapping of subglacial bed topography, significant sectors of Antarctica remain poorly resolved and critical spatial details are missing. Here we present a novel, high-resolution and physically based description of Antarctic bed topography using mass conservation. Our results reveal previously unknown basal features with major implications for glacier response to climate change. For example, glaciers flowing across the Transantarctic Mountains are protected by broad, stabilizing ridges. Conversely, in the marine basin of Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, we find retrograde slopes along Ninnis and Denman glaciers, with stabilizing slopes beneath Moscow University, Totten and Lambert glacier system, despite corrections in bed elevation of up to 1 km for the latter. This transformative description of bed topography redefines the high- and lower-risk sectors for rapid sea level rise from Antarctica; it will also significantly impact model projections of sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-12-13 04:15:39,"e9yy9t","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,19,NA,"A team of glaciologists has unveiled the most accurate portrait yet of the contours of the land beneath Antarctica’s ice sheet – and, by doing so, has helped identify which regions of the continent are going to be more, or less, vulnerable to future climate warming.",0.95,19,0,2019-12-13 04:14:52,2019-12-13

____

**Abstract**

In recent decades, the Greenland Ice Sheet has been a major contributor to global sea-level rise, and it is expected to be so in the future. Although increases in glacier flow and surface melting have been driven by oceanic and atmospheric warming, the degree and trajectory of today’s imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual satellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet’s volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. Although the ice sheet was close to a state of balance in the 1990s, annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 335 ± 62 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,800 ± 339 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.6 ± 0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that reduced surface mass balance has driven 1,971 ± 555 billion tonnes (52%) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,827 ± 538 billion tonnes (48%) of ice loss was due to increased glacier discharge, which rose from 41 ± 37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 ± 25 billion tonnes per year since then. Between 2013 and 2017, the total rate of ice loss slowed to 217 ± 32 billion tonnes per year, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured cooler conditions and as ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbræ. Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the IPCC’s predicted rates for their high-end climate warming scenario, which forecast an additional 50 to 120 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 when compared to their central estimate.

"fag6pz8",1,"Indeed as aClimateScientist mentioned, if you were to simply look at conduction, meaning the energy that is transferred between two objects/molecules that come into physical contact, a molecule of CO2 will have a much more higher chance of coming into contact with O2 or N2, as they are the primary elements in the lower atmosphere. Not necessarily peer reviewed, but a quick look on the internet allowed me to compare concentrations of O2, N2 and CO2 in terms of ppm ([http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/atmospheric-composition](http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/atmospheric-composition)). One can see that the amount of CO2 molecules is far lesser than that of the main two. In the eventually that CO2 does come into contact with another CO2 molecule, when evaluating the effectiveness of conduction, one must look at the thermal conductivity of the materials. In general, air is a poor conductor, but what about CO2 itself? Well, another quick look online ( [https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/carbon-dioxide-thermal-conductivity-temperature-pressure-d\_2019.html](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/carbon-dioxide-thermal-conductivity-temperature-pressure-d_2019.html) ) allowed me to find the thermal conductivity of CO2 gas at around 220K (-50C, which is somewhat the temperature we expect at the top of the troposphere) and we find a thermal conductivity of 0.0106 W/m K. On the other hand, air ( [https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-properties-viscosity-conductivity-heat-capacity-d\_1509.html](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-properties-viscosity-conductivity-heat-capacity-d_1509.html) ) has a thermal conductivity of 0.02041W/m K. This means that CO2 actually has a harder time transferring heat by conduction than air at similar temperatures! (Granted these tables don't really take into account the change in air pressure, but it still gives a good enough picture). Likewise, when you look at materials that are effective at transfering heat like concrete, we find a wooping value of  384.1W/m K for temperature around 25C!","climate_science",2019-12-11 05:25:21,"e4ng4y","MorningGlory747",0,1,0,TRUE,2017-09-01 01:17:04,0,0,131,1136,1267,15,"
Am I correct in thinking that the primary greenhouse warming mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- the molecule becomes more energetic and transfers it's energy to surrounding molecules via collisions 

And the secondary mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- after some time that molecule may emit an infrared photon as a result.  
- if the direction of emission is downwards then the photon will either strike another CO2 molecule, or strike the earth's surface, warming it.

Because the majority of layman's information sources only mention the second mechanism.

"fabrp13",1,"I don't think it's the only way. This may be a terrible assumption, but I'm guessing you're from the United States? The reality is that the rest of the world is in general far more progressive when it comes to climate policy, and our major competitors - especially China - see the future of the global green economy, and want controlling stake in it.

____

**Abstract**

The benefits of the 1987 Montreal Protocol in reducing chlorofluorocarbon emissions, repairing the stratospheric ozone hole, shielding incoming UV radiation, reducing the incidence of skin cancer and mitigating negative ecosystem effects are all well documented. Projected future climate impacts have also been described, mainly focused on a reduced impact of the mid-latitude jet as the ozone hole gradually repairs. However, there is little appreciation of the surface warming that has been avoided as a result of the Montreal Protocol, despite CFCs being potent greenhouse gases. Instead, the issue of ozone depletion and climate change are often thought of as two distinct problems, even though both ozone and CFCs impact Earth's radiation budget. Here we show that a substantial amount of warming has been avoided because of the Montreal Protocol, even after factoring in the surface cooling associated with stratospheric ozone depletion. As of today, as much as 1.1 °C warming has been avoided over parts of the Arctic. Future climate benefits are even stronger, with 3 °C–4 °C Arctic warming and ~1 °C global average warming avoided by 2050; corresponding to a ~25% mitigation of global warming. The Montreal Protocol has thus not only been a major success in repairing the stratospheric ozone hole, it has also achieved substantial mitigation of anthropogenic climate change both today and into the future.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-12-07 09:47:59,"e7cikf","avogadros_number",0,3,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,16,NA,"Thanks to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement signed in 1987 to stop CFCs from destroying the ozone layer, today’s global temperatures are considerably lower.

On the surface this fact might make it seem like we don't need to worry about temperature increasing... after all it has been very high before, right? That however, overlooks the major issue: the rate of warming. In the past when the bottoms of the deep oceans averaged around 20*C as opposed to (2*C today) and life abounded from pole to pole the warming had occurred at rates allowing for natural selection to keep pace; today it isn't, which is the defining factor and overall major issue.","climate_science",2019-12-07 00:05:08,"e70nug","RagePoop",0,1,0,TRUE,2011-07-02 20:14:36,0,0,62029,281441,343470,26,"I have heard that there is a climate tipping point, beyond which things will only spiral out of control, the world effectively ends, civilization collapses and Humanity goes extinct.

"f9vcpfm",3,"The world isn't going to ""end"". Equilibrium climate sensitivity is between 2 and 4.5, and equilibrium isn't reached for hundreds of years. Currently CO2ppm is going up about 2.11 per year, some years a little more, some a little less, with the rate of CO2 acceleration declining (eventually, it will peak). We are at 410 CO2 ppm. A doubling would be around 550 Ppm. We are, at current rates, barely on track to get there this century, with a peak in emissions likely within the first half of this century (judging by rates of decline in countries that have already peaked, a global peak would be followed by declines of at least 1 percent per year, hell, the USA has no regulations and awful climate policies, and we are on track for a 1.7 percent emissions decline this year.). Now, if we are dreadfully wrong about climate sensitivity, or we don't peak in the next 30 years, things could get very bad. We will have to intervene with aggressive albedo management and possibly cloud seeding. But we as a species manage to survive some awful landscapes. We have survived for over a year in domes disconnected from the rest of the world. Unless you believe we cannot migrate, there's no rational reason to believe that even in the worst of the worst case scenario human beings cannot survive. Likely many mammals would survive with us in human created wildlife parks (during the PETM, mammal populations expanded, and temperatures were 15 degrees c warmer than they are today. Obviously humans would need to assist moving wildlife to better climates, as habitats are highly disconnected). But such is dystopian and hypothetical. Even the feedbacks you think of are mostly thought of as secondary to human emissions, with us still largely in control (especially if we can do land albedo management and some cloud seeding).

"f9ujxz8",18,"&gt;I have heard that there is a climate tipping point,

There are several tipping points. They are irreversible events that have significant impacts on the climate. They are ""triggered"" at different amounts of warming and some may have already been triggered. However, there is not one tipping point, instead a whole host of them that behave very differently.

You have probably already read this paper but it explains this brilliantly. Figure 3 is useful.

If you would like any more information, feel free to ask.

Edit: This explanation was not the best. They do not happen within a few minutes or days. They can take 100 years to take place and due to the gradual behaviour, it can even be difficult to know if they have been triggered. Some tipping points, such as the Amazon forest dieback have regularly specific causation parameters. But others do not, as Shakhova says ""50Gt of methane is highly possible for abrupt release at any time"". As we do not know when these tipping points will be triggered, hoping that they do not occur is incredibly naïve.","climate_science",2019-12-06 17:11:31,"e70nug","Griff1619",0,18,0,TRUE,2018-07-14 11:42:46,0,0,483,1783,2266,26,"I have heard that there is a climate tipping point, beyond which things will only spiral out of control, the world effectively ends, civilization collapses and Humanity goes extinct.

[Heatland Institute](https://www.desmogblog.com/heartland-institute)

&gt; The Heartland Institute has received at least $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998 but no longer discloses its funding sources. The Union of Concerned Scientists found (PDF) that “Nearly 40% of the total funds that the Heartland Institute has received from ExxonMobil since 1998 were specifically designated for climate change projects.”

You'll find many ""think tanks"" (propaganda groups really) that are dedicated to misleading the public about climate change. They spread many stories, which are not even consistent with each other.

The Heartland Institute also used to work for tobacco companies, to spread the idea that scientists were not really sure about the connection between smoking and lung cancer.

Climate science connects a lot of things, and scientists love to cross validate data and ideas. For temperatures, they use several series of ground measurements, satellite measurements, and ocean temperatures as well (the oceans have stored most of the energy from the additional greenhouse effect). They can also observe in real time the spectrum of light that is emitted by the surface of the Earth and captured by the atmosphere, directly proving and quantifying the greenhouse effect. We also see the consequences of increased temperatures, like glaciers melting, increased moisture in the air and heavier rains (on average), stronger winds, species moving to new habitats and changes in ocean currents. Every discipline keeps the others in check, and there is zero doubt about the general ideas of climate change.

**Abstract**

Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are associated with the largest climate perturbations in Earth’s history. The North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) and Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) constitute an exemplar of this association. As yet we have no means to reconstruct the pacing of LIP greenhouse gas emissions for comparison with climate records at millennial resolution. Here, we calculate carbon-based greenhouse gas fluxes associated with the NAIP at sub-millennial resolution by linking measurements of the mantle convection process that generated NAIP magma with observations of the individual geological structures that controlled gas emissions in a Monte Carlo framework. These simulations predict peak emissions flux of 0.2–0.5 PgC yr^(–1) and show that the NAIP could have initiated PETM climate change. This is the first predictive model of carbon emissions flux from any proposed PETM carbon source that is directly constrained by observations of the geological structures that controlled the emissions.

**Plain Language Summary**

Climate models provide an important way to understand future changes in the Earth's climate. In this paper we undertake a thorough evaluation of the performance of various climate models published between the early 1970s and the late 2000s. Specifically, we look at how well models project global warming in the years after they were published by comparing them to observed temperature changes. Model projections rely on two things to accurately match observations: accurate modeling of climate physics, and accurate assumptions around future emissions of CO2 and other factors affecting the climate. The best physics‐based model will still be inaccurate if it is driven by future changes in emissions that differ from reality. To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2 (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts, and increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming.


**Abstract**

Retrospectively comparing future model projections to observations provides a robust and independent test of model skill. Here we analyse the performance of climate models published between 1970 and 2007 in projecting future global mean surface temperature (GMST) changes. Models are compared to observations based on both the change in GMST over time and the change in GMST over the change in external forcing. The latter approach accounts for mismatches in model forcings, a potential source of error in model projections independent of the accuracy of model physics. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were skillful in predicting subsequent GMST changes, with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations, particularly when mismatches between model‐projected and observationally‐estimated forcings were taken into account.

**Abstract**

Cryptocurrency mining uses significant amounts of energy as part of the proof-of-work time-stamping scheme to add new blocks to the chain. Expanding upon previously calculated energy use patterns for mining four prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero), we estimate the per coin economic damages of air pollution emissions and associated human mortality and climate impacts of mining these cryptocurrencies in the US and China. Results indicate that in 2018, each $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $0.49 in health and climate damages in the US and $0.37 in China. The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change “cryptodamages” roughly match each $1 of coin value created. We close with discussion of policy implications.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-12-02 08:43:04,"e4w9zk","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,4,NA,"The environmental cost of cryptocurrency mines - researchers estimate that in 2018, every $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $.49 in health and climate damages in the United States.",0.83,4,0,2019-12-02 08:41:50,2019-12-02

**Significance**

The benefit of climate change for forests is that higher atmospheric CO2 allows trees to use less water and photosynthesize more. The problem of climate change is that warmer temperatures make trees use more water and photosynthesize less. We predicted the outcome of these opposing influences using a physiologically realistic model which accounted for the potential adjustment in forest leaf area and related traits to future conditions. If forests fail to adjust, only 55% of climate projections predict a CO2 increase large enough to prevent warming from causing significant drought and mortality. If forests can adjust, the percentage of favorable outcomes rises to 71%. However, uncertainty remains in whether trees can adjust rapidly and in the scatter among climate projections.

**Abstract**

The response of forests to climate change depends in part on whether the photosynthetic benefit from increased atmospheric CO2 (∆Ca = future minus historic CO2) compensates for increased physiological stresses from higher temperature (∆T). We predicted the outcome of these competing responses by using optimization theory and a mechanistic model of tree water transport and photosynthesis. We simulated current and future productivity, stress, and mortality in mature monospecific stands with soil, species, and climate sampled from 20 continental US locations. We modeled stands with and without acclimation to ∆Ca and ∆T, where acclimated forests adjusted leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and stand density to maximize productivity while avoiding stress. Without acclimation, the ∆Ca-driven boost in net primary productivity (NPP) was compromised by ∆T-driven stress and mortality associated with vascular failure. With acclimation, the ∆Ca-driven boost in NPP and stand biomass (C storage) was accentuated for cooler futures but negated for warmer futures by a ∆T-driven reduction in NPP and biomass. Thus, hotter futures reduced forest biomass through either mortality or acclimation. Forest outcomes depended on whether projected climatic ∆Ca/∆T ratios were above or below physiological thresholds that neutralized the negative impacts of warming. Critically, if forests do not acclimate, the ∆Ca/∆T must be above ca. 89 ppm⋅°C^(−1) to avoid chronic stress, a threshold met by 55% of climate projections. If forests do acclimate, the ∆Ca/∆T must rise above ca. 67 ppm⋅°C^(−1) for NPP and biomass to increase, a lower threshold met by 71% of projections.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-12-02 08:33:34,"e4w3zh","avogadros_number",0,0,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,4,NA,"Forests face climate change tug of war - Which force, CO2 fertilization or heat stress, wins this climate tug of war depends on whether forests and trees are able to adapt to their new environment.",0.83,4,0,2019-12-02 08:23:10,2019-12-02

Shakhova et al 2008 discusses the possibility of a 50Gt release from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS).

She only found that 50Gt of the methane hydrates were ""unstable and highly possible for abrupt release at any time"". So while the rest exist, they are not unstable (as of  2008).

There is also an issue of depth, in shallow conditions (approximately 20m below the water) the methane is not oxidised and is (essentially) fully released into the atmosphere.

&gt;The choice of the temperature metric depends on the purpose of the application: (1) if the goal is to evaluate models against observations or for detection and attribution, use the blended-masked temperature metric -i.e. GBST (same as the observations).

Also, ""little ice age"" is actually defined to start in 1300, but I am more interested in the latter part of that period,say 1650-1850 which corresponds to Maunder and Dalton solar minima and generally colder climate than before that.

That LIA was generally colder is evidenced also by [ice cores](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051260), which corroborate the 0.5 degree temperature drop.

"f8t3204",4,"&gt; The above says that plankton help to lower atmospheric CO2.

Of course they do.  No one said otherwise.  That's how the carbon cycle works.

&gt; This says that plankton stocks are low.

No, it says plankton productivity is declining as a result of current changes.  ""Low"" is a relative term.

&gt; If plankton play a big part in lowering atmospheric CO2, but plankton productivity is lower during the industrial era, what outcome would this have?

It would act as yet another in a long list of feedbacks that both result from anthropogenic warming and also increase the forcing emsemble acting in concert with our emissions.  That an activity causes an uptick in CO2 doesn't automatically make it the *cause* of 20th century warming since the dawn of the industrial era.  You said ""a result of"", which is a causal link.  I'm saying the source you provided *did not show that causal link.*  Correlation does not equal causation.

You then failed to provide evidence to support the assertion that they *are* wrong.  You still have an opportunity to do so, but doubling down on an existing source which says nothing of the sort is a bad way to go.

"f8suizj",5,"That source does not suggest that a decline in phytoplankton productivity has led to or caused the increase in CO2 that we see currently.  That decline, in fact, is attributed to:

&gt; a massive accumulation of freshwater (around 15,000 km3 from 1965 to 1990) into the subarctic Atlantic basin follow-ing the great salinity anomaly28 of the late 1960s

They continue:

&gt; According to the relationships that we found, the decrease in upper-ocean densities associated with this event, which has been hypothesized to have weakened deep-water formation across the Labrador and Irminger Seas6,28, may also have led to a diminishing of northern Atlantic planktonic stocks, presumably either through long-term shoaling of the wintertime depth of the mixed layer and the gradual diminishing of euphotic nutrient concentrations1,5,9, or through first-order thermal influences Furthermore, the onset of industrial-era declines in Arctic sea ice and elevated GrIS runoff, which started several decades after our productivity decline and are currently accelerating15,16, suggests that a long-term influx of fresh water into (that is, a freshening of ) northeastern subarctic Atlantic surface waters—similarly implicated in driving the industrial-era AMOC decline1,6–8—may have contributed in sustaining the industrial-era productivity decline over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

From [other sources](https://www.us-ocb.org/industrial-era-climate-forcing-drives-multi-century-decline-na-productivity/):

&gt; the early 19th century onset of declining productivity coincides with the regional onset of industrial-era surface warming, and also strongly covaries with regional sea surface temperatures and basin-scale gyre circulation strength

So no, that source does not support your assertion that ""CO2 is higher now than over the past 800,000 years...[as] a result of reduced phytoplankton productivity which has been linked to the weakened AMO"".  In fact, Industrial Era warming has brought with it a freshwater pulse which is disrupting large scale Atlantic currents which are inhibiting plankton productivity by limiting nutrient fluxes into the deep ocean, so the causality is exactly reversed.

Most of the discrepancy might come from reconstructions that are dominated by summer-temperature proxies (there are actually papers on that).

"f8rzt92",0,"Looking into past ipcc reports for a “reference to billions of people going to die, or children in 20 years.” seems a bit naive. As we look into the behavior of social systems we will have to rely on strategic reasoning/common sense. It is clear that humanity will be challenged to maintain organized society if environmental and geopolitical pressures increase as expected within a 4 degrees C warmer planet by 2100. Most tragically, the earth system could have entered an irreversible long-term hothouse earth dynamic by then.

In general, a thorough understanding of the magnitude and urgency of the anthropogenic climate emergency is an essential prerequisite for understanding the necessity of a #GreatTransition and its policy instruments. At the level of science and thought leadership, a robust consensus within the field of climate science has been firmly established thanks to the support of the IPCC. However, Naomi Oreskes and Michael Oppenheimer recently found that the pace of climate change may have been consistently underestimated in the past, due to the desire to converge on the least controversial and most conservative positions. This makes it possible to overlook the fat-tail risks of climate change: low-probability high-impact possibilities within a probability distribution that are more significant than they would be in a normal distribution. In this context, the economist Martin Weitzman defines the climate crisis by its “structural uncertainty about [its] potentially open-ended catastrophic reach”. Xu and Ramanathan rightly point out that while a 1:20 probability estimate, for example, may seem relatively small, most people wouldn’t want to board a plane with a 5% risk of coming down, nor would they want to send their children and grandchildren on that plane. An example for a worst-case scenario based on fat-tail risks has been analyzed by David Spratt and Ian Dunlop. Assuming a mean global temperature increase of 3 degrees C already by 2050, it is anticipated that 35 percent of the global land area, and 55 percent of the global population could be subject to more than 20 days a year of heat conditions lethal to the human body. In conclusion, Oreskes and Oppenheimer recommend that climate scientists experiment with alternative models for making and expressing group judgments, and learn more about how policy makers actually interpret the findings that result.  


With regard to the field of economics, a joint study by climate scientists from LSE, PIK and Columbia University has found out that past economic risk assessments “have been omitting or grossly underestimating many of the most serious consequences for lives and livelihoods”, including the potential for mass migration, displacement and conflict. And it is not only that that the practice of exponential discounting has contributed to a grave delay of climate action in favor of short-term economic growth in the past. In his Nobel Memorial Prize presentation in 2018, the economist William Nordhaus, a major and certainly well-meaning contributor to the IPCC’s Working Group III, is reported to have described a stabilization at a mean global temperature increase of 4 degrees C by 2140 as “optimal” from on an economic cost-benefit perspective. However, considering the dramatic ecological and social consequences of such a temperature increase, it should be apparent that the assumption of continuous economic progress until the end of this century is incompatible with the current business-as-usual carbon emissions trajectory. But according to an analysis by the economist Steve Keen, it appears that the damage function applied by Working Group III failed to consider the possibility of tipping points and ecological and societal discontinuities. The resulting economic damage estimate of a 3.6% global GDP fall for a 4 degree C global warming scenario severely underrepresents the actual social and economic costs to be anticipated. In consequence, the past conclusions of WG III of the IPCC must be revised. Political leaders and policy makers need to be informed. Going forward, a more interdisciplinary, ecologically and ethically informed economic practice, where the risk of societal and economic discontinuities are taken into consideration, is urgently needed.

Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

**Abstract**

Electricity generation is a large contributor to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. However, the demographic distribution of the resulting exposure is largely unknown. We estimate exposures to and health impacts of PM2.5 from electricity generation in the US, for each of the seven Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), for each US state, by income and by race. We find that average exposures are the highest for blacks, followed by non-Latino whites. Exposures for remaining groups (e.g., Asians, Native Americans, Latinos) are somewhat lower. Disparities by race/ethnicity are observed for each income category, indicating that the racial/ethnic differences hold even after accounting for differences in income. Levels of disparity differ by state and RTO. Exposures are higher for lower-income than for higher-income, but disparities are larger by race than by income. Geographically, we observe large differences between where electricity is generated and where people experience the resulting PM2.5 health consequences; some states are net exporters of health impacts, other are net importers. For 36 US states, most of the health impacts are attributable to emissions in other states. Most of the total impacts are attributable to coal rather than other fuels.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-21 08:03:43,"dzg2uz","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,14,NA,"Some Communities Feel the Effects of Air Pollution More Than Others - A new study compares exposure to power plant emissions among communities based on race, income, and geography.

**Abstract**

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important long-lived GHG and an important stratospheric ozone depleting substance. Agricultural practices and the use of N-fertilizers have greatly enhanced emissions of N2O. Here, we present estimates of N2O emissions determined from three global atmospheric inversion frameworks during the period 1998–2016. We find that global N2O emissions increased substantially from 2009 and at a faster rate than estimated by the IPCC emission factor approach. The regions of East Asia and South America made the largest contributions to the global increase. From the inversion-based emissions, we estimate a global emission factor of 2.3 ± 0.6%, which is significantly larger than the IPCC Tier-1 default for combined direct and indirect emissions of 1.375%. The larger emission factor and accelerating emission increase found from the inversions suggest that N2O emission may have a nonlinear response at global and regional scales with high levels of N-input.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-20 18:40:27,"dz68kc","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"Human-driven N₂O emissions have been growing unabated for many decades, but we may have been seriously underestimating by just how much",0.76,2,0,2019-11-20 18:39:34,2019-11-20

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Understanding the response of atmospheric blocking events to climate change has been of great interest in recent years. However, potential changes in the blocking area (size), which can affect the spatio‐temporal characteristics of the resulting extreme events, have not received much attention. Using two large‐ensemble, fully‐coupled GCM simulations, we show that the size of blocking events increases with climate change, particularly in the northern hemisphere (by as much as $17\%$). Using a two‐layer quasi‐geostrophic model and a dimensional analysis technique, we derive a scaling law for the size of blocking events, which shows that area mostly scales with width of the jet times the Kuo scale (i.e., the length of stationary Rossby waves). The scaling law is validated in a range of idealized GCM simulations. Predictions of this scaling law agree well with changes in blocking events' size under climate change in fully‐coupled GCMs in winters but not in summers.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-18 04:34:21,"dxy9ug","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,18,NA,"Stalled weather patterns will get bigger due to climate change - study uncovers relationship between jet stream, atmospheric blocking events",0.95,18,0,2019-11-18 04:32:57,2019-11-18

Analyses of this countermovement have primarily focused on the role of conservative think tanks. Expanding this research, this article initiates an examination of the structure of key political coalitions that worked to oppose climate action. In conjunction with their allied trade associations, these coalitions have served as a central coordination mechanism in efforts opposed to mandatory limits on carbon emissions. These coalitions pool resources from a large number of corporations and execute sophisticated political and cultural campaigns designed to oppose efforts to address climate change. Through an analysis of twelve prominent CCCM coalitions from 1989 to 2015, I show that over 2,000 organizations were members of these coalitions and that a core of 179 organizations belonged to multiple coalitions. Organizations from the coal and electrical utility sectors were the most numerous and influential organizations in these coalitions. The article concludes with suggestions for further research to expand understanding of complex social movements and countermovements.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-16 09:54:05,"dx4yn3","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"Utilities, coal companies and railroads are the most significant players in the climate change countermovement, working to undermine public faith in climate science and effectively block action by the U.S. government to regulate emissions.",0.81,3,0,2019-11-16 09:53:31,2019-11-16

**Abstract**

Methane has been rising rapidly in the atmosphere over the past decade, contributing to global climate change. Unlike the late 20th century when the rise in atmospheric methane was accompanied by an enrichment in the heavier carbon stable isotope (^(13)C) of methane, methane in recent years has become more depleted in ^(13)C. This depletion has been widely interpreted as indicating a primarily biogenic source for the increased methane. Here we show that part of the change may instead be associated with emissions from shale-gas and shale-oil development. Previous studies have not explicitly considered shale gas, even though most of the increase in natural gas production globally over the past decade is from shale gas. The methane in shale gas is somewhat depleted in ^(13)C relative to conventional natural gas. Correcting earlier analyses for this difference, we conclude that shale-gas production in North America over the past decade may have contributed more than half of all of the increased emissions from fossil fuels globally and approximately one-third of the total increased emissions from all sources globally over the past decade.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-15 01:58:47,"dwjpdc","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,13,NA,"Study links rise in methane emissions to the boom in U.S. shale gas and oil production",0.89,13,0,2019-11-15 01:53:19,2019-11-15

**Abstract**

As the global food system contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, understanding the sources of GHG emissions embodied in different components of food systems is important. The collapse of the Soviet Union triggered a massive restructuring of the domestic food systems, namely declining consumption of animal products, cropland abandonment, and a major restructuring of agricultural trade. However, how these complex changes have affected global GHG emissions is uncertain. Here, we quantified the net GHG emissions associated with changes in the former Soviet Union's food systems. Changes in food production, consumption, and trade together resulted in a net emissions reduction of 7.61 Gt carbon dioxide equivalents from 1992 to 2011. For comparison, this corresponds to one quarter of the CO2 emissions from deforestation in Latin America from 1991 to 2011. The key drivers of the emissions reductions were the decreasing beef consumption in the 1990s, increasing beef imports after 2000, mainly from South America, and carbon sequestration in soils on abandoned cropland. Ongoing transformations of the food systems in the former Soviet Union, however, suggest emissions will likely rebound. The results highlight the importance of considering agricultural production, land-use change, trade, and consumption when assessing countries emissions portfolios. Moreover, we demonstrated how emissions reductions that originate from a reduction in the extent and intensity of agricultural production can be compromised by increasing emissions embodied in rising imports of agricultural commodities.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-12 17:12:11,"dvcx1u","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,9,NA,"Soviet collapse saved the atmosphere from 7.61 billion tonnes of CO2",1,9,0,2019-11-12 17:11:04,2019-11-12

**Abstract**

Permafrost is thawing extensively due to climate warming. When permafrost thaws, previously frozen organic carbon (OC) is converted into carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane, leading to further warming. This process is included in models as gradual deepening of the seasonal non‐frozen layer. Yet, models neglect abrupt OC mobilization along rapidly eroding Arctic coastlines. We mimicked erosion in an experiment by incubating permafrost with seawater for an average Arctic open‐water season. We found that CO2 production from permafrost OC is as efficient in seawater as without. For each gram (dry weight) of eroding permafrost, up to 4.3 ± 1.0 mg CO2 will be released and 6.2 ± 1.2% of initial OC mineralized at 4 °C. Our results indicate that potentially large amounts of CO2 are produced along eroding permafrost coastlines, onshore and within nearshore waters. We conclude that coastal erosion could play an important role in carbon cycling and the climate system.

**Plain Language Summary**

The permanently frozen soils of the Arctic, known as permafrost, store large amounts of organic carbon, which accumulated over millennia due to slow decomposition in the cold Arctic regions. With climate warming this frozen organic carbon reservoir thaws and microbes recycle it quickly into greenhouse gases, which in turn support further warming. A slow and continuous thaw is currently used in models to project future greenhouse gas release from permafrost. Yet along the rapidly eroding coastlines of the Arctic Ocean, which make up 34% of the Earth's coastlines, whole stretches of the coast simply collapse, sink or slide into the ocean, including the previously frozen organic carbon. We simulated greenhouse gas release in response to coastline collapse in a laboratory experiment by simply mixing permafrost with seawater. We show that large amounts of carbon dioxide are being produced during the Arctic open‐water season. Our study indicates that eroding permafrost coasts in the Arctic are potentially a major source of carbon dioxide. With increasing loss of sea ice, longer open‐water seasons, and exposure of coasts to waves, we highlight the importance of coastal erosion for potential carbon dioxide emissions.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-08 07:33:10,"dtbzyr","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,13,NA,"Arctic coastlines have not been considered carefully in carbon cycles for long, but new research suggests that eroding permafrost may emit more greenhouse gases than previously thought.",0.93,13,0,2019-11-08 07:31:50,2019-11-08

**Abstract**

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and is targeted for emissions mitigation by the US state of California and other jurisdictions worldwide. Unique opportunities for mitigation are presented by point-source emitters—surface features or infrastructure components that are typically less than 10 metres in diameter and emit plumes of highly concentrated methane. However, data on point-source emissions are sparse and typically lack sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to guide their mitigation and to accurately assess their magnitude. Here we survey more than 272,000 infrastructure elements in California using an airborne imaging spectrometer that can rapidly map methane plumes. We conduct five campaigns over several months from 2016 to 2018, spanning the oil and gas, manure-management and waste-management sectors, resulting in the detection, geolocation and quantification of emissions from 564 strong methane point sources. Our remote sensing approach enables the rapid and repeated assessment of large areas at high spatial resolution for a poorly characterized population of methane emitters that often appear intermittently and stochastically. We estimate net methane point-source emissions in California to be 0.618 teragrams per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.523–0.725), equivalent to 34–46 per cent of the state’s methane inventory for 2016. Methane ‘super-emitter’ activity occurs in every sector surveyed, with 10 per cent of point sources contributing roughly 60 per cent of point-source emissions—consistent with a study of the US Four Corners region that had a different sectoral mix. The largest methane emitters in California are a subset of landfills, which exhibit persistent anomalous activity. Methane point-source emissions in California are dominated by landfills (41 per cent), followed by dairies (26 per cent) and the oil and gas sector (26 per cent). Our data have enabled the identification of the 0.2 per cent of California’s infrastructure that is responsible for these emissions. Sharing these data with collaborating infrastructure operators has led to the mitigation of anomalous methane-emission activity.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-08 07:31:00,"dtbz6n","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"A Third of California Methane Traced to a Few Super-Emitters - Methane point-source emissions in California are dominated by landfills (41%), followed by dairies (26%) and the oil and gas sector (26%).",0.81,3,0,2019-11-08 07:29:27,2019-11-08

"f6txsz7",13,"Hello Tuck,

Valid questions! First of all, I have to disagree with your assertion that most people’s opinions on climate change are politically based. Anecdotally- all people I know who are activists against human caused climate change are activists because of their scientific beliefs. 

Your questions have to do with the global carbon cycle (which I have attached a link to below). Essentially what is happening is that human emissions are offsetting the global near-balance of carbon between the ocean, land and air. Though human emissions are small in comparison to the natural sinks and emissions of the world they are enough to disrupt the cycle. We emit approximately 29 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Much is then taken into the oceans etc, but lots remains in the atmosphere adding to the greenhouse effect.

"f6rcd29",3,"\&gt;it's not clear that the temperature is rising. 

I'm going ""yes it is"" on this.

There's several groups keeping track of the temperature, some using completely different data. (Satellites instead of temperature stations). 

[http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1970/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1970/plot/rss](http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1970/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1970/plot/rss)

\&gt;Temperatures have been high in the past (when dinosaurs were about). 

Yeah. In some ways it's the same temperature. In that we're digging up the carbon that was in the atmosphere in the long past and putting it back.

And that would not be problematic if we were interested in the survival of mesosuars and stegosaurs. But, alas, they're already extinct. We're looking to keep current ecosystems alive and current infrastructure. And for the past couple or few million years the CO2 has alternated between 190 and 290ppm. It's departure from that that nothing alive today has had to live with.

\&gt; even if it was, 2 degrees doesn't seem much, and I don't see how it will affect me.

It depends where you live. Is he near the ocean? In a wheat or maise growing area? Near a desert? A flood plane?

It will affect ecosystems. For the example of eucalyptus in Australia, 41% of species have a range covering less than 2°C . That means they are comitted to extinction for a 2°C rise, unless they migrate outside their current range. Trees don't migrate quickly, and you have to go upwards or polewards, and eventually you run out of space.

So the disruption to ecosystems is more than you might think.

"f6qshrw",1,"That last point is key because it's the emotional aspect and (since they deny basic accepted facts) is likely the foundation upon which the rest of their opinion is based. Most people form opinions like this to support an emotional reaction to the social aspects of a movement, which are usually the channels through which they are introduced to the issue in the first place. 

The best strategy I've found is to explore that emotional part of their argument. Don't attack them, don't make assumptions, just ask questions. If you reach a central issue/point around which their ideas orbit repeat it back to them in the most general terms and ask if they would apply the same thought process elsewhere. The key is not to oppose their position, but to get them to thoroughly explain (and by extension, examine) the central assumptions they use to form their position.

"f6q84ej",5,"* It's 100% clear that the temperatures are rising, there is zero debate anywhere about that. The temperature has risen 1.0 C so far and we are locked in for 1.5 C and racing towards &gt; 2 C. An important point about this is the concept of thermal interia - think about when you apply heat to a pot of water, the water doesn't quickly reach the temperature, but if you apply heat to a solid object it heats up quicker.  This is because of the high heat capacity of water and once that water heats up it releases water vapour (another powerful greenhouse gas) and takes along time to cool down.  This is what's happening to the oceans, they will continue to heat up for decades even if we stopped emitting GHG tomorrow. 
* A big issue with the temperature rise is how quickly it's occurring.  Yes if the temperature slowly over thousands or even just hundreds of years changed life would adapt and we'd probably be fine.  But the rate of change is over just a few short decades, even humans will struggle to adapt. 
* It's important to understand 2 C rise doesn't mean that a 23 C day becomes a 25 C day and that the rise is uniform across the globe.  There are actually some areas that will become colder and in the tropics they are already witness &gt; 2 C and will likely see 6 C temp rise which is fucking huge and deadly.  You can't drive this point in hard enough. It's not a uniform change.  The way your friend is likely thinking about it is how as a process engineer thinks of a process shift, which is to say the temperature just shifts up 2 C and that is not what is happening.  The **extremes** push the average up which is an increase in instability.  And it's those extremes that cause the air to hold more water and dump massive down pours and then suddenly shift to suck up all that moisture again.  This is how we are witnessing micro droughts in the southern United States and this sort of phenomena will increase and it *is* and *will continue* to affect crop production.
* He's wrong, there have been many deadly events.  The problem is, if we are honest it's hard to say a particular weather event like the heat wave in Moscow that killed 55,000 people or the heat wave in Europe  that killed 70,000 or Sandy or Katrina etc... is directly related to global climate change.  We can say that the trend of these extreme events is due to climate change and that climate change increases the wind speed and energy dissipation of hurricanes etc... 
* The fact that the changes are year over year now should scare the fuck out of anyone being honest with themselves.  I don't know how old your friend is, but I'm old enough to have witnessed the shift.  It's here and it's getting worse every year.  Any honest somewhat educated person taking a stone cold look at the facts will understand the dire situation we face now and in the coming years, so i wouldn't waste too much time trying to convince them.  They likely don't want to see it, because it is very very scary. Make sure to educate yourself and learn as much as you can.

"f6pvsf7",3,"1) AVERAGE climate change is rising. Yes there have been cycles in the past but this dinosaurs didn't CAUSE those cycles. We are. Specifically what makes us different from the dinosaurs is that the dinosaurs didn't have an industrial revolution. Our industrial revolution and subsequent rise in co2 and other chemical pollution coincides with the global increase in temperature.

It could be a coincidence - but given the scientific backing - we should go ahead and improve the planet anyway.

2) Plants and their yields are very susceptible to environment. 2 more degrees on average (btw the prediction is closer to 4 now) means in the hot times and in the cold. This effects everything from crop yields to polinating insects to disease. 2 degrees will likely cause food shortages, and hence climate refugees. This may lead to food riots and a police state. On top of this is wild weather and subsequent damage to buildings homes and property... And it all being a regular occurrence. Expect economic and health problems. Deaths from heat waves, and a general sense of panic and anxiety... Oh and increased diseases for humans too... And none of that even touches on ocean acidification from all the cargo ships pumping exhaust directly into the water killing marine life on mass. 

3) Prior to WW1 Europe was in a relatively calm state of monarchies. Prior to September 11 people weren't felt up and scanned at airports. Prior to the volcano at Pompeii it was a nice place to live. Prior to the meteorite the dinosaurs were the apex predator... The past doesn't necessarily predict the future... But even the past is currently saying - temperatures are going up.

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.  
 

My question is, being an average person who reads the news as well as a small number of scientific papers, what do I tell these members of my family regarding what Dr. Christy is saying in order to help move them away from this? I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well. The fact of the matter too is that I simply don't have enough knowledge or evidence on hand to dispute what he's saying, other than trying to remember that one article/paper I read whenever ago and trying to dig it out and on and on.

____

**Significance**

Sea-level rise poses a threat to coastal areas and will continue for centuries, even after global mean temperature has stabilized. Research assessing the implications of current international climate mitigation efforts usually focuses on 21st century climate impacts. The multicentennial sea-level rise commitment of pledged near-term emission reduction efforts under the Paris Agreement has not been quantified yet. We here estimate this sea-level rise commitment and find that pledged emissions until 2030 lock in 1-m sea-level rise in the year 2300. Our analysis highlights the defining role of present-day emissions for future sea-level rise and points to the potential of reducing the long-term sea-level-rise commitment by more ambitious national emission reduction targets.

**Abstract**

The main contributors to sea-level rise (oceans, glaciers, and ice sheets) respond to climate change on timescales ranging from decades to millennia. A focus on the 21st century thus fails to provide a complete picture of the consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on future sea-level rise and its long-term impacts. Here we identify the committed global mean sea-level rise until 2300 from historical emissions since 1750 and the currently pledged National Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement until 2030. Our results indicate that greenhouse gas emissions over this 280-y period result in about 1 m of committed global mean sea-level rise by 2300, with the NDC emissions from 2016 to 2030 corresponding to around 20 cm or 1/5 of that commitment. We also find that 26 cm (12 cm) of the projected sea-level-rise commitment in 2300 can be attributed to emissions from the top 5 emitting countries (China, United States of America, European Union, India, and Russia) over the 1991–2030 (2016–2030) period. Our findings demonstrate that global and individual country emissions over the first decades of the 21st century alone will cause substantial long-term sea-level rise.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-05 13:43:03,"drzass","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,13,NA,"Global greenhouse gas emissions up to 2030 could be enough to raise sea levels by more than one metre by 2300, a new study suggests",0.93,13,0,2019-11-05 13:42:12,2019-11-05

"f6kgo4v",3,"I’m a few days late to this thread but I can relate a lot to your concerns. I started reading about climate change a couple years ago and my initial reaction was one of hopelessness and immense fear of the future. “How could we have let things get so bad? What can we do to fix it? What will this mean for my life and life of my family?”. These were all questions that I had bouncing around in my head.

I began looking into the issue, but unfortunately it is such a polarized  one that it can be hard to find and analyze information if you don’t have a science background (which I don’t) and are unfamiliar with a lot of the terminology and methods. I have since tried to stick to what the science was saying and, while I still worry about what this will mean for our future, I am not feeling panicked like I was when I first started learning about climate change. It’s bad. But there is still plenty we can do to make it better. I also have noticed a lot more attention on the issue recently and think that public support for fighting climate change is only going to grow faster and faster. Seeing young people like Greta Thunburg bring attention to this has also made me very hopeful. People are starting to realize that we can’t drag our feet on this anymore than we have, and I’m hopeful that we’ll see even more activists like her drawing attention to it.

Like I said I’m not a scientist and there has already been some great responses here, so I’ll just say that the best way to reduce your anxiety on this issue is to, oddly enough, inform yourself more about it and the actions that you can take individually. I found that once I knew more about what we are up against and what the actual science is saying, it wasn’t  as scary as when I felt overwhelmed by it all. Also be careful when it comes to articles about climate change. The headlines can often be misleading, either downplaying the issue or exaggerating it depending on the audience. Even on subreddits like r/worldnews I’ve notice that people rarely read the actual content of articles that are posted, only reading the title and drawing a conclusion from it alone. Don’t fall into that trap, and also try to read the actual studies and other sources from scientific journals. Those are the best source for info but can be a bit dry to read, or confusing for a layman. Hope I helped in some way, and just know that things are getting better, it’s just gonna take a while.","climate_science",2019-11-05 00:00:14,"dpf3y9","STOPSENDINGMEHENTAI",0,3,0,TRUE,2018-05-05 21:08:07,125,0,9265,14862,24252,12,"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

**Abstract**

Atomic-level understanding of the active sites and transformation mechanisms under realistic working conditions is a prerequisite for rational design of high-performance photocatalysts. Here, by using correlated scanning fluorescence X-ray microscopy and environmental transmission electron microscopy at atmospheric pressure, in operando, we directly observe that the (110) facet of a single Cu2O photocatalyst particle is photocatalytically active for CO2 reduction to methanol while the (100) facet is inert. The oxidation state of the active sites changes from Cu(i) towards Cu(ii) due to CO2 and H2O co-adsorption and changes back to Cu(i) after CO2 conversion under visible light illumination. The Cu2O photocatalyst oxidizes water as it reduces CO2. Concomitantly, the crystal lattice expands due to CO2 adsorption then reverts after CO2 conversion. The internal quantum yield for unassisted wireless photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol using Cu2O crystals is ~72%.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-04 17:24:56,"drku0p","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,7,NA,"Scientists create 'artificial leaf' that turns carbon dioxide into fuel",0.77,7,0,2019-11-04 17:23:53,2019-11-04

____

**Abstract**

Identifying processes within the Earth System that have modulated atmospheric pCO₂ during each glacial cycle of the late Pleistocene stands as one of the grand challenges in climate science. The growing array of surface ocean pH estimates from the boron isotope proxy across the last glacial termination may reveal regions of the ocean that influenced the timing and magnitude of pCO₂ rise. Here we present two new boron isotope records from the subtropical‐subpolar transition zone of the Southwest Pacific that span the last 20 kyr, as well as new radiocarbon data from the same cores. The new data suggest this region was a source of carbon to the atmosphere rather than a moderate sink as it is today. Significantly higher outgassing is observed between ~16.5 and 14 kyr BP, associated with increasing δ^(13)C and [CO₃]^(2−) at depth, suggesting loss of carbon from the intermediate ocean to the atmosphere. We use these new boron isotope records together with existing records to build a composite pH/pCO₂ curve for the surface oceans. The pH disequilibrium/CO₂ outgassing was widespread throughout the last deglaciation, likely explained by upwelling of CO₂ from the deep/intermediate ocean. During the Holocene, a smaller outgassing peak is observed at a time of relatively stable atmospheric CO₂, which may be explained by regrowth of the terrestrial biosphere countering ocean CO₂ release. Our stack is likely biased toward upwelling/CO₂ source regions.

**Abstract**

Projections of global rice yields account for climate change. They do not, however, consider the coupled stresses of impending climate change and arsenic in paddy soils. Here, we show in a greenhouse study that future conditions cause a greater proportion of pore-water arsenite, the more toxic form of arsenic, in the rhizosphere of Californian Oryza sativa L. variety M206, grown on Californian paddy soil. As a result, grain yields decrease by 39% compared to yields at today’s arsenic soil concentrations. In addition, future climatic conditions cause a nearly twofold increase of grain inorganic arsenic concentrations. Our findings indicate that climate-induced changes in soil arsenic behaviour and plant response will lead to currently unforeseen losses in rice grain productivity and quality. Pursuing rice varieties and crop management practices that alleviate the coupled stresses of soil arsenic and change in climatic factors are needed to overcome the currently impending food crisis.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-04 06:05:15,"drdhzu","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,5,NA,"Rice yields plummet and arsenic rises - Research combining future climate conditions and arsenic-induced soil stresses predicts rice yields could decline about 40% by 2100, a loss that would impact about 2 billion people dependent on the global crop.",1,5,0,2019-11-04 06:01:56,2019-11-04

The foundation of the denial of climate science is not a position undertaken by individuals with logically sound arguments and reason. It is either a failure of critical thinking (valid arguments but not sound, or simply invalid arguments) or rooted in ideological conditions that predispose one to reject factual statements over one's own personal belief system. If it's an issue with critical thinking, it could likely be corrected for by showing different types of fallacious arguments and which one they are potentially invoking to support their arguments^[1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799) . On the other hand, and I could very well be wrong, I believe that dogmatic personal belief systems cannot be changed by the showing facts - rather this may entrench them further in regard to their personal belief. For example, note the Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate when Ken Ham is asked ""What if anything would ever change your mind?"" and he replies that the bible is the word of God and that ""as far as the word of God is concerned, no one's ever going to convince me that the word of God is not true.""","GlobalClimateChange",2019-11-04 05:59:05,"dqwl6n","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,13,"I see things that give various time limits on ""life as we know it"" ranging between 10-50 years.

"f6he19k",3,"As individuals, we can’t just stop climate change by going vegan and halting all fossil fuel burning. It takes some systemic change. It’s unrealistic that every individual can/will cut their footprint dramatically— technology needs to make it cheaper/easier, and governments have to encourage people to do it (ideally by implementing a carbon tax). Imagine the life of a farmer in midwestern USA. They need tractors, they need to drive far, and there’s no electric charging stations nearby. Totally unreasonable for them to live a low fossil fuel life. Generally anywhere rural its challenging to ditch your car.

However, there’s some systemic changed we can influence as individuals. If we go vegan, restaurants have to change to serve us. If we stop flying, and opt for more video calls and vacationing locally our culture can shift. Those are important changes to make. It also might be easy for you to pay for renewable energy, depending on where you live.


I highly recommend you take a look at your carbon footprint quantitatively for a bit to understand where you’re at now and the biggest places you can cut carbon. We have a carbon footprint calculator at https://projectwren.com that might help too. It offers some general suggestions tailored to your footprint, too. (disclaimer—I founded the company.

I don’t fly, but it’s taken me 2 decades to have what people would consider a low carbon lifestyle. Thing is, I don’t use those metrics.

I personally have deep misgivings about carbon accounting as a stand-alone metric (once in college we considered them) but I see how it may prove useful, at least in getting a handle on some personal impacts. However we can still cut emissions and not really help matters, as many other exploitation’s against both people and planet can still be maintained on that path, -via resource over use and over consumption in the pursuit of financial gains, resulting in polluting wastes (including co2). This is the consideration I’d like to see adopted.

If you need meat (many do) then investigate the supply, look for local and enquire into the manner by which they are farmed...and slaughtered if animal ethics concern you.
Please don’t let the expectation of selfish actors worry you, this is a snowball effect that simply requires individuals to act and inspire others.

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.

I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

"f5y8e8q",1,"&gt;&gt; Are we locked in for 2 - 3 oC regardless? It seems odd that IPCC wold put forth a plan that they know is going to fail (e.g. their proposed carbon budget in order to stay below 2oC)

A key note about carbon budgets is they output a probability distribution of warming under various models. It's not like a shopping budget where you pick your items off the shelf and they ring you up and you get what you paid for. What you pay for with a carbon budget is a *chance* of limiting heating to a given level. The carbon budget you reference from the SR1.5 report is for a 66% chance of limiting heating to 1.5C I believe. That is, it has a roughly 1/3 chance of failing to limit heating to that range. If this seems an obscenely low chance of probability of success to accept for such an important target, that's because it is. It's chosen essentially because safer probabilities imply carbon budgets that are essentially impossibly small- ie, this is a matter of public relations rather than a tangible goal. It is a way of denying/minimizing exactly how badly the global leadership and dominant economic system has already failed on the climate crisis. Prof. Michael Mann recently criticized the assumptions underlying the SR 1.5 budgetary analysis as being too conservative with regards to expected heating.

Based on IPCC AR5, it's possible that 2C is already geophysically locked in, a good estimate is that this is the case with about 25% percent probability. That is, the carbon budget for a 75% chance of limiting heating to 2C is already zero. For greater probabilities the budget is negative. See David Spratt [""The real budgetary emergency and the myth of burnable carbon""](https://www.climatecodered.org/2014/05/the-real-budgetary-emergency-burnable.html)



[This talk by Prof. Kevin Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZFvc-ZOa8&amp;t=38s), who has experience with carbon budget analysis, disambiguates some of the issues around the contradiction between the hard reality of real mitigation for 2C and the policy recommendations of the IPCC Workging Group III(which are made by economists and political scientists without vetting from climate scientists). IPCC WG III is constitutionally incapable of recommending the radical policy shifts that real mitigation entails because such policy conflicts directly with the dominant neoliberal economic growth centered agenda, and their promulgation of speculative negative emissions technologies to be deployed over the coming century to suck hundreds of gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere can be viewed as an attempt to mythologize the abject failure of neoliberalism versus the climate crisis. By conjuring up hundreds of gigatons of negative emissions, they generate fictitious policy framework carbon budgets that are roughly double the budgets that derive from physical science. This essentially contitutes fixing the facts around the policy (economic growth at all costs) rather than basing the policy in the facts (extremely fast real mitigation is needed to hold 2C, at a rate inconsistent with market based policy and economic growth.)

Essentially, mitigation in line with 2C constitutes a radical global socioeconomic transformation beyond anything the world is currently countenancing and given the history of inertia over the last decades it seems very unlikely that the world will be capable of pulling it off. See here for a [condensed 6 minute presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDCQkrRJmA) on this.


Prof. Anderson and Prof. Steve Keen have called out the policy advice of the IPCC. Anderson has accused WGIII of ""technocratic fraud"" and Prof. Keen has called for economists to be ""removed from the IPCC.""

Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.  
 

My question is, being an average person who reads the news as well as a small number of scientific papers, what do I tell these members of my family regarding what Dr. Christy is saying in order to help move them away from this? I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well. The fact of the matter too is that I simply don't have enough knowledge or evidence on hand to dispute what he's saying, other than trying to remember that one article/paper I read whenever ago and trying to dig it out and on and on.

____

**Abstract**

Palaeo-oceanographic reconstructions indicate that the distribution of global ocean water masses has undergone major glacial–interglacial rearrangements over the past ~2.5 million years. Given that the ocean is the largest carbon reservoir, such circulation changes were probably key in driving the variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations observed in the ice-core record. However, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of the ocean’s role in regulating CO2 on these timescales. Here, we show that glacial ocean–sea ice numerical simulations with a single-basin general circulation model, forced solely by atmospheric cooling, can predict ocean circulation patterns associated with increased atmospheric carbon sequestration in the deep ocean. Under such conditions, Antarctic bottom water becomes more isolated from the sea surface as a result of two connected factors: reduced air–sea gas exchange under sea ice around Antarctica and weaker mixing with North Atlantic Deep Water due to a shallower interface between southern- and northern-sourced water masses. These physical changes alone are sufficient to explain ~40 ppm atmospheric CO2 drawdown—about half of the glacial–interglacial variation. Our results highlight that atmospheric cooling could have directly caused the reorganization of deep ocean water masses and, thus, glacial CO2 drawdown. This provides an important step towards a consistent picture of glacial climates.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-31 17:46:31,"dpr30b","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"Antarctic sea ice is key to triggering ice ages, study finds",1,2,0,2019-10-31 17:46:01,2019-10-31

"f5x7xd0",2,"&gt;then around ~2040 we will go from 280 ppm Co2 to ~560 ppm and temperatures are expected to be 5.3oC - 7oC - this

5.3C is a figure for ECS from CESM2. The E in ECS means Equilibrium, therefore we will experience this warming when the earth system enters equilibrium. That takes a few hundred years. Therefore 5.3C is a figure for about 2400.

&gt;Yeah i definitely understand why models tend to stop at 2100... no point in going past it as modern society will be long gone...

There are a few reasons, I am currently talking about this with u/aClimateScientist

&gt;Sorry i don't follow the debate. Shouldn't observational data be taken over any model - it seems odd to assume the models are right when someone is presenting actual evidence. Well this is even more concerning. I tried googling it but couldn't find anything that seems reputable. I did find a lot debunking articles ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LifcMZyCYmc) from what appear to be renown scientists. 

It's a bit more nuanced, but yes observations should take priority over models (in some cases not as observational ECS measurements have been a bit weird)

&gt;What is the expected time frame till it goes off - 5 - 10 years? and how rapidly will we feel the effects? I'd think its fairly instant.

For the methane release, Shakhova says ""abrupt release at any time"". So possibly under 5 years. As it would be sudden release of methane (about 50Gt, 50 billion tonnes), this warming would portray itself in about 1-2C warming almost instantaneously. I have been quite approximate because we do not quite know how these hydrates behave.

&gt;this seems to be orders or magnitude greater than what IPCC put out in their Special Report 1.5. I though the plan was that in order to stay below 2oC by 2100 we would need to be carbon neutral by 2050.

&gt;Why isn't the IPCC including this in their reports and summary in bold letters on top of everything?

For a wealth of reasons, the IPCC often don't include some of the more niche areas of climate science. The IPCC does acknowledge that CO2 will be released from the Arctic, it does not include methane release.

Again, I don't feel like typing up an essay about it, but the IPCC tend to be quite conservative, their SLR (Sea Level Rise) and temperature predictions tend to be on the lower side. They also have 4.5C has a top end of their ECS predictions, lower than the newer models.","climate_science",2019-10-31 15:46:08,"dpf3y9","Griff1619",0,2,0,TRUE,2018-07-14 11:42:46,0,0,483,1783,2266,12,"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread.

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.

His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well.

Fact of the matter is that we will die eventually and the earth will roll around the sun for millions of years and it eventually will be swallowed by the sun. Until then, it will be fine and it will thrive. So we worry about the earth?! What you're actually worried about is our species. Why?!!

My question would be, why are you bothered by it? I mean earth will be fine in few thousand years. A lot of species have died of even before we came here. So why should we bother to be preserving the nature? What's the point?!! Even after humanity is gone, earth will still rotate around the sun.

&amp;#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

"f5wr91b",0,"&gt;But newer models have a higher ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity). Meaning that they predict more warming when the earth system is in equilibrium after a doubling of CO2. CESM2 had one of 5.3, and one modelling centre for CIMP6 came up with 7C by 2100. Again, that is extremely high and should be taken with scepticism. However, a higher ECS does tend to be a trend and is extremely worrying, meaning that steeper emissions cuts are needed.

That is downright frightening... but i also don't fully understand it. If i understood this link correctly: [https://news.ucar.edu/132678/ncars-new-climate-model-running-hot](https://news.ucar.edu/132678/ncars-new-climate-model-running-hot), then around \~2040 we will go from 280 ppm Co2 to \~560 ppm and temperatures are expected to be 5.3oC - 7oC - this seems to be orders or magnitude greater than what IPCC put out in their Special Report 1.5. I though the plan was that in order to stay below 2oC by 2100 we would need to be carbon neutral by 2050.

Yeah i definitely understand why models tend to stop at 2100... no point in going past it as modern society will be long gone...

&gt; She has found that some of these hydrates are unstable and could release their methane at any time. However, her observations were quickly whisked away when the models said otherwise. Dr Peter Wadhams has talked about this but it created an interesting precedent, who to trust, observations or models? 

Sorry i don't follow the debate. Shouldn't observational data be taken over any model - it seems odd to assume the models are right when someone is presenting actual evidence. Well this is even more concerning. I tried googling it but couldn't find anything that seems reputable. I did find a lot debunking articles ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LifcMZyCYmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LifcMZyCYmc)) from what appear to be renown scientists. 

Why isn't the IPCC including this in their reports and summary in bold letters on top of everything? I feel like I am missing something here. What is the expected time frame till it goes off - 5 - 10 years? and how rapidly will we feel the effects? I'd think its fairly instant.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Just quickly looking, 3C is possible, but 1.5C is essentially impossible. I have not read the rest though.

"f5w3yv5",-2,"&gt;I don't think we are affecting the climate with our CO2 levels.

&gt;Fair enough. Why do you think that? Is it because you read something? Just resigned it out?

CO2 and temperature don't correlate in the deeper geological time there are graphs that show this. 

Also sea rise is linear if you look at the graphs at 2 to 3mm a year and temp rise is 0.02 rise in a linear fashon. All the sea rise alarmism is from the 'climate models that show acceleration'. In the real world there is no acceleration.

Finally green house gas is 2% of the atmosphere. 95% is water vapour. 4% is CO2 . Most CO2 is from the plants and ocean and is part of the carbon cycle. Only 3% of the 4% is from man made 8 billion people trying to survive. 

The IPCC only looks at this 3% and does no research on water vapour , cloud seeding etc. 

So. not enough evidence.Also the Ice caps are growing in Antartica and are presently at 2007 levels in the Arctic.

The downside of removing CO2 quickly is over 100 billion euros are going to be wasted on 'more reseach' [Horizon Europe] and continued 3rd world poverty.

&gt; I want a child

I would advise against it, for the obvious reason that it will probably live beyond 2100. 

Edit: As u/aClimateScientist said, not all models stop at 2100, and some CIMP6 models go to 2300. But if you look at most papers and models, they will stop their predictions at 2100, for reasons such as lowered accuracy.

I would like to clarify my position on this, I am trying to say that we are not fully sure just how things are going to go past 2100, yes some models do go beyond 2100 but lots of climate science stops there. We can have a guess that it will be bad. And just as the IPCC assuming that carbon capture will come into existence soon, assuming that your child's generation will solve it is a bad idea.

Beyond that, models stop, so we have literally no idea what will happen and you are giving that uncertainty to your child.

&gt;I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before

Like u/aClimateScientist said, it is partly because of clouds. Clouds are the wildcards in climate modelling, a relatively small change can massively alter a model and we have not quite pinned down how they will change in the future. But newer models have a higher ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity). Meaning that they predict more warming when the earth system is in equilibrium after a doubling of CO2. CESM2 had one of 5.3, and one modelling centre for CIMP6 came up with 7C by 2100. Again, that is extremely high and should be taken with scepticism. However, a higher ECS does tend to be a trend and is extremely worrying, meaning that steeper emissions cuts are needed.

&gt;*extinction within the next 50 years?*

Calm down McPherson!

&gt;I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory

The clathrate gun is no longer really supported, it is a hypothesis in which methane release causes a chain of methane release. And while there are positive feedbacks in the methane hydrates, the clathrate gun goes beyond that. Natalia Shakhova is an Arctic researcher who has been studying methane hydrates for about 20 years. She has found that some of these hydrates are unstable and could release their methane at any time. However, her observations were quickly whisked away when the models said otherwise. Dr Peter Wadhams has talked about this but it created an interesting precedent, who to trust, observations or models?

Shakhova's results are more aligned with a methane bomb than with the clathrate gun. Igor Semelitov, another Arctic researcher who has worked with Shakhova has joust found very intense plumes of methane in the Arctic Ocean.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? 

The carbon budget is the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released for a certain amount of warming. Again, it varies greatly and climate sensitivity plays a role.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

It does appear to be unlikely, but with the methane release and the other feedbacks, it is important to have a high-end estimate.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

**Abstract**

Over the past eight hundred thousand years, glacial–interglacial cycles oscillated with a period of one hundred thousand years (‘100k world’). Ice core and ocean sediment data have shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide, Antarctic temperature, deep ocean temperature, and global ice volume correlated strongly with each other in the 100k world. Between about 2.8 and 1.2 million years ago, glacial cycles were smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration (‘40k world’). Proxy data from deep-sea sediments suggest that the variability of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 40k world was also lower than in the 100k world, but we do not have direct observations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from this period. Here we report the recovery of stratigraphically discontinuous ice more than two million years old from the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area, East Antarctica. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in ice core samples older than two million years have been altered by respiration, but some younger samples are pristine. The recovered ice cores extend direct observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane, and Antarctic temperature (based on the deuterium/hydrogen isotope ratio δD_ice, a proxy for regional temperature) into the 40k world. All climate properties before eight hundred thousand years ago fall within the envelope of observations from continuous deep Antarctic ice cores that characterize the 100k world. However, the lowest measured carbon dioxide and methane concentrations and Antarctic temperature in the 40k world are well above glacial values from the past eight hundred thousand years. Our results confirm that the amplitudes of glacial–interglacial variations in atmospheric greenhouse gases and Antarctic climate were reduced in the 40k world, and that the transition from the 40k to the 100k world was accompanied by a decline in minimum carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial maxima.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-31 06:48:43,"dpjs4t","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"Researchers have published the first direct measurements of atmospheric gases from the worlds oldest ice core (2.7 million years old) with a surprising find - Air bubbles from 1.5 million years ago contain lower than expected levels of carbon dioxide",1,3,0,2019-10-31 06:48:13,2019-10-31

___

**Abstract**

Intact tropical forests, free from substantial anthropogenic influence, store and sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon but are currently neglected in international climate policy. We show that between 2000 and 2013, direct clearance of intact tropical forest areas accounted for 3.2% of gross carbon emissions from all deforestation across the pantropics. However, full carbon accounting requires the consideration of forgone carbon sequestration, selective logging, edge effects, and defaunation. When these factors were considered, the net carbon impact resulting from intact tropical forest loss between 2000 and 2013 increased by a factor of 6 (626%), from 0.34 (0.37 to 0.21) to 2.12 (2.85 to 1.00) petagrams of carbon (equivalent to approximately 2 years of global land use change emissions). The climate mitigation value of conserving the 549 million ha of tropical forest that remains intact is therefore significant but will soon dwindle if their rate of loss continues to accelerate.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-31 06:47:23,"dpjrrv","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,12,NA,"Climate emissions from tropical forest damage 'underestimated by a factor of six' - Scientists say policymakers must better account for climate impacts of damage to forests, and benefits of conserving them",1,12,0,2019-10-31 06:46:56,2019-10-31

There are four decisions made in plotting these graphs that are problematic: 

* Choice of baseline,
* Inconsistent smoothing,
* Incomplete representation of the initial condition and structural uncertainty in the models,
* No depiction of the structural uncertainty in the satellite observations.

One example in relation to the above graph:

Christy purports to be using 5-yr running mean smoothing, and mostly he does. However at the ends of the observational data sets, he is using a 4 and then 3-yr smoothing for the two end points. This is equivalent to assuming that the subsequent 2 years will be equal to the mean of the previous 3 and in a situation where there is strong trend, that is unlikely to be true.

Just a follow up. Could you please elaborate on what you mean why the collapse of modern society? Are you referring to a regression to farming/agricultural lives after hundreds of millions perish? Or is the concern that we won't have economic growth and we may have less types of fish in the supermarket?

"f5v86wa",11,"Hi friend, I’m a 25 year old climate scientist who works on climate modelling and collaborates with several authors of the IPCC. We are not worried about human extinction. We *are* concerned that collapse of *modern* society, in which we’ve come to expect continuous economic growth and quality of life improvements, is within the realm of possibility in high-emissions scenarios and especially for regions of the world that are most vulnerable (e.g. low-lying poor countries in the tropics).

The CMIP6 models are running hot compared to CMIP5 models (the previous generation), but I think the climate community takes this with a grain of salt as this is mostly due to changes in clouds which we don’t necessarily trust very much.","climate_science",2019-10-31 01:24:08,"dpf3y9","[deleted]",0,11,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,12,"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

(A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use.

"f5v3xrs",5,"You seem reasonable, and few of us are reading actual research papers. But I have some questions


&gt;	I don't think we are affecting the climate with our CO2 levels.

Fair enough. Why do you think that? Is it because you read something? Just resigned it out?

&gt;	I hate the 'time pressure' bad car salesman approach of the climate doomsters in that we have to act now routine.

I agree. Alarmist rhetoric makes me uncomfortable. Take a second to yourself in their shoes - If you’re watching the temperature graphs go up, and they match the CO2 graphs well enough to convince you that’s the problem (their shoes, not yours), and you hear that melting ice may release even more CO2, reflect less light back to space and cause the seas to rise. If weather changes enough that we have to move where we farm to places without years and years of soil buildup (or indoors), etc etc. if even half of that is true, it does fee like the house is on fire and sounding the alarm is the only responsible thing to do. 

I’m not asking you to accept the predictions, just understand the reactions of the people who do. Many of them have read tons on the subject and are seeking the best information they can find from any source (not just a Facebook group - this isn’t like antivaxx “science”). They’re seeing agreeing findings from such a variety of places - governments and agencies from all around the globe, scientists, private companies, etc Exxon themselves came to this conclusion decades ago.

You don’t have to be convinced by this data, but take a kind stance towards those who do.

Specifically answering to this. Hello from Germany!

I thought we were phasing out coal, not building any new. Did a quick research anyways.

https://endcoal.org/tracker/ shows just one shameful unit for Germany under construction. It's [Kraftwerk Datteln](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk_Datteln), where apparently they want to replace an old block-unit with a new one. Construction started in 2007, but a court stopped it in 2009. There was quite a back and forth, until construction continued in 2017.

Most of our coal plants are operating or retired.

According to the tracker, Japan does build quite a number of coal power plants.

**Abstract**

Most estimates of global mean sea-level rise this century fall below 2 m. This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASA’s SRTM. CoastalDEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show – employing CoastalDEM—that 190 M people (150–250 M, 90% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 250 M below 1 m.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-30 00:39:14,"doz7c4","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"New elevation data triple estimates of global vulnerability to sea-level rise and coastal flooding",1,10,0,2019-10-30 00:38:49,2019-10-30
"f5qpspq",1,"Oh dear, that’s a dreadful take away from this work. Good science(ish) hindered by blinkered thinking I fear.
I’d like to see the conclusion note instead that: only for farming practices analysed these negative values are reached, therefore it is farming practices specifically (and perhaps a return to bio regional demand) that need to change in order to optimise organic farming yields to the greater rates achieved elsewhere, so as to result in both lower emissions along with the plethora of additional benefits we obtain from growing organic food.

From a quick read I think the paper demonstrates commendable analysis but within a very narrow focus of business and practice as usual projected into the future, thus creating bias in favour of non organic farming. Also a lot of poor practice meat farming.

No mention of alternative measures (aside from co2 emissions) to compare practices. What about water use or yields in drought years? Much better for organic.
Nor nutritional content, calorific value etc as models to determine productivity.
I understand this was a fairly necessary limitation in order to conduct such a study, but there are other/better models to employ. Needs mention.
Additionally the huge array of alternative farming practices, types of food grown, changes in diet, advances in harvesting etc etc that will occur over time as we transition (hopes) will all effect results and should be commented on as limitations.
The generalised figure for Organics yield was quite low imho and must include the entire gamut of less than suitable crops, (eg baby spinach) Which would also then be based on current demands...which would adapt...yadda yadda

**Abstract**

Agriculture is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and must feature in efforts to reduce emissions. Organic farming might contribute to this through decreased use of farm inputs and increased soil carbon sequestration, but it might also exacerbate emissions through greater food production elsewhere to make up for lower organic yields. To date there has been no rigorous assessment of this potential at national scales. Here we assess the consequences for net GHG emissions of a 100% shift to organic food production in England and Wales using life-cycle assessment. We predict major shortfalls in production of most agricultural products against a conventional baseline. Direct GHG emissions are reduced with organic farming, but when increased overseas land use to compensate for shortfalls in domestic supply are factored in, net emissions are greater. Enhanced soil carbon sequestration could offset only a small part of the higher overseas emissions.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-28 21:52:15,"dog2ds","avogadros_number",0,5,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,15,NA,"Going entirely organic could mean food emissions up 70% in England and Wales",1,15,0,2019-10-28 21:51:14,2019-10-28

"f4ph5x4",1,"Study: [Sustained wood burial in the Bengal Fan over the last 19 My](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/10/15/1913714116)
___

**Significance**

The Bengal Fan is the largest sedimentary deposit in the world and has previously been shown to represent a major sink of carbon that may have contributed to the Cenozoic cooling trend. Wood transport has been observed in rivers during the high flows of the monsoon season, or associated with events such as cyclones, earthquake-triggered landslide and dam-and-release events from the mountains. However, wood was not widely thought to survive export and burial in the oceans. This study shows that woody debris can survive thousands of kilometers of transport in rivers and in turbidites, to be deposited in the fan. Wood has been overlooked in quantification of organic carbon burial on continental margins.

**Abstract**

The Ganges–Brahmaputra (G-B) River system transports over a billion tons of sediment every year from the Himalayan Mountains to the Bay of Bengal and has built the world’s largest active sedimentary deposit, the Bengal Fan. High sedimentation rates drive exceptional organic matter preservation that represents a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2. While much attention has been paid to organic-rich fine sediments, coarse sediments have generally been overlooked as a locus of organic carbon (OC) burial. However, International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 354 recently discovered abundant woody debris (millimeter- to centimeter-sized fragments) preserved within the coarse sediment layers of turbidite beds recovered from 6 marine drill sites along a transect across the Bengal Fan (∼8°N, ∼3,700-m water depth) with recovery spanning 19 My. Analysis of bulk wood and lignin finds mostly lowland origins of wood delivered episodically. In the last 5 My, export included C4 plants, implying that coarse woody, lowland export continued after C4 grassland expansion, albeit in reduced amounts. Substantial export of coarse woody debris in the last 1 My included one wood-rich deposit (∼0.05 Ma) that encompassed coniferous wood transported from the headwaters.

**Significance**

Debate lingers over what caused the last mass extinction 66 million years ago, with intense volcanism and extraterrestrial impact the most widely supported hypotheses. However, without empirical evidence for either’s exact environmental effects, it is difficult to discern which was most important in driving extinction. It is also unclear why recovery of biodiversity and carbon cycling in the oceans was so slow after an apparently sudden extinction event. In this paper, we show (using boron isotopes and Earth system modeling) that the impact caused rapid ocean acidification, and that the resulting ecological collapse in the oceans had long-lasting effects for global carbon cycling and climate. Our data suggest that impact, not volcanism, was key in driving end-Cretaceous mass extinction.

**Abstract**

Mass extinction at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary coincides with the Chicxulub bolide impact and also falls within the broader time frame of Deccan trap emplacement. Critically, though, empirical evidence as to how either of these factors could have driven observed extinction patterns and carbon cycle perturbations is still lacking. Here, using boron isotopes in foraminifera, we document a geologically rapid surface-ocean pH drop following the Chicxulub impact, supporting impact-induced ocean acidification as a mechanism for ecological collapse in the marine realm. Subsequently, surface water pH rebounded sharply with the extinction of marine calcifiers and the associated imbalance in the global carbon cycle. Our reconstructed water-column pH gradients, combined with Earth system modeling, indicate that a partial ∼50% reduction in global marine primary productivity is sufficient to explain observed marine carbon isotope patterns at the K-Pg, due to the underlying action of the solubility pump. While primary productivity recovered within a few tens of thousands of years, inefficiency in carbon export to the deep sea lasted much longer. This phased recovery scenario reconciles competing hypotheses previously put forward to explain the K-Pg carbon isotope records, and explains both spatially variable patterns of change in marine productivity across the event and a lack of extinction at the deep sea floor. In sum, we provide insights into the drivers of the last mass extinction, the recovery of marine carbon cycling in a postextinction world, and the way in which marine life imprints its isotopic signal onto the geological record.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-22 07:14:09,"dleapj","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"Ocean acidification can cause mass extinctions, fossils reveal",1,11,0,2019-10-22 07:12:16,2019-10-22

____

**Significance**

How the magnitude of El Niño will change is of great societal concern, yet it remains largely unknown. Here we show analysis of how changing El Niño properties, due to 20th century climate change, can shed light on changes to the intensity of El Niño in the future. Since the 1970s, El Niño has changed its origination from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific, along with increased strong El Niño events due to a background warming in the western Pacific warm pool. This suggests the controlling factors that may lead to increased extreme El Niño events in the future. If the observed background changes continue under future anthropogenic forcing, more frequent extreme El Niño events will induce profound socioeconomic consequences.

**Abstract**

El Niño’s intensity change under anthropogenic warming is of great importance to society, yet current climate models’ projections remain largely uncertain. The current classification of El Niño does not distinguish the strong from the moderate El Niño events, making it difficult to project future change of El Niño’s intensity. Here we classify 33 El Niño events from 1901 to 2017 by cluster analysis of the onset and amplification processes, and the resultant 4 types of El Niño distinguish the strong from the moderate events and the onset from successive events. The 3 categories of El Niño onset exhibit distinct development mechanisms. We find El Niño onset regime has changed from eastern Pacific origin to western Pacific origin with more frequent occurrence of extreme events since the 1970s. This regime change is hypothesized to arise from a background warming in the western Pacific and the associated increased zonal and vertical sea-surface temperature (SST) gradients in the equatorial central Pacific, which reveals a controlling factor that could lead to increased extreme El Niño events in the future. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models’ projections demonstrate that both the frequency and intensity of the strong El Niño events will increase significantly if the projected central Pacific zonal SST gradients become enhanced. If the currently observed background changes continue under future anthropogenic forcing, more frequent strong El Niño events are anticipated. The models’ uncertainty in the projected equatorial zonal SST gradients, however, remains a major roadblock for faithful prediction of El Niño’s future changes.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-21 20:50:35,"dl6pak","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"Climate change is making stronger El Ninos, which change weather worldwide and heat up an already warming planet, a new study finds",1,3,0,2019-10-21 20:49:00,2019-10-21

Generally, Consider the impacts of arctic amplification - expect your area to warm 1.5-2x the global average land temperature. Greater impact of droughts (And perhaps flash droughts) or longer droughts, Forests fires (if there's forest around you) increasing in rate and severity, early frosts out of nowhere, or false-springs, etc. Expect temperature and humidity levels to surpass the optimal for many crops - potatoes, corn, wheat, etc- during heat waves that are longer and hotter over time. 

Also, keep in that the impacts of both mitigation and adaptation. A carbon tax will need to be seriously implemented at some point (not this piddly thing the Libs have implemented) - this will mean the current tax will need to increase at 8-10% y/y, starting soon, and going for decades. The IPCC puts forward numbers such as ~$2,000 / ton by 2050 (Or ~ $600/ton by 2030) imagine how that would impact your operation? Also, The medium-long term impact on the availability of heavy steel machinery (need lots of fossil fuels, global trade networks, exploitation of child slaves, etc) is doubtful in a world that seriously tries to effect climate action. Also, your nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers are likely from the Haber-Bosch and phosphate rock mining industries - both heavily dependent and reliant on fossil fuels - expect these to increase in price greatly, or reduce in availability (or both!). Look at moving to local fertilization, crop rotation, silvopasture, etc methods (if you're not already) in order to localize your supply chain as a buffer against market and resource instabilities caused by climate change. Expect it to become harder - when have changes ever been good for farmers? The rest of society undervalues the role of agriculture and food production.  

On the adaptation side, extensive water capture and storage facilities would be highly suggested, as you will be facing increasingly severe (And possibly lengthy) droughts. Not sure if you have an aquifer there, and how it's projected stores are looking if so. I know wells are becoming harder to depend on - my family has 3 sections in Alberta (for over 100 yrs now) and our 5th well (200ft) just ran dry. Shipping in water for the cattle weekly now.  Expect this, but more and worse. Local resilience and redundancy for basic needs - feed, water, drought-resistant crops, etc. will be key. Diversify crops and terrains - try some multi-layered perennial food forests, some machine-harvest ready crops, some drought-resistant crops, greenhouse crops, mushrooms, semi-tropical fruits) etc. The classics won't work anymore, and adaptation, breeding, and diversification will be the name in the game in insulating yourself from climate chaos caused production shocks. 

On the other hand, there could be some benefits. There will likely be more extensive carbon capture and sequestration projects put into place - perhaps there will be more carbon credits for increasing terrestrial sequestration, or reforesting part of your land, etc. I know there are carbon credits in Alberta to do with seed drills already - this could expand, and those with lots of land will be a prime target for such endeavors.","climate_science",2019-10-21 08:24:02,"dkkiy9","TheNewN0rmal",0,2,0,FALSE,NA,25,0,0,0,25,3,"In particular the northern clay belt but open to any and all information.

"f3rvojo",3,"From the Abstract:

""The real-world variations mean that historical EffCS underestimates CO2CO2 EffCS by 30% when considering the entire historical period. The difference for recent decades implies that either unforced variability or the response to volcanic forcing causes a much stronger regional pattern of sea surface temperature change in the real world than in AOGCMs. We speculate that this could be explained by a deficiency in simulated coupled atmosphere–ocean feedbacks which reinforce the pattern (resembling the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in some respects) that causes the low EffCS. We conclude that energy-balance estimates of CO2CO2 EffCS are most accurate from periods unaffected by volcanic forcing. Atmosphere GCMs provided with observed sea surface temperature for the 1920s to the 1950s, which was such a period, give a range of about 2.0–4.5 K, agreeing with idealised CO2CO2 AOGCM experiments; the consistency is a reason for confidence in this range as an estimate of CO2CO2 EffCS. Unless another explosive volcanic eruption occurs, the first 30 years of the present century may give a more accurate energy-balance historical estimate of this quantity.""","climate_science",2019-10-14 22:37:55,"dhye17","KeybladeAxel19",0,3,0,TRUE,2015-05-28 01:35:48,124,0,2231,146,2501,25,NA,"How accurately can the climate sensitivity to CO2 be estimated from historical climate change?",0.92,25,0,2019-10-14 22:37:36,2019-10-14

**Abstract**

Production of animal protein is associated with high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Globally, oyster aquaculture is increasing as a way to meet growing demands for protein, yet its associated GHG-emissions are largely unknown. We quantified oyster aquaculture GHG-emissions from the three main constituents of GHG-release associated with terrestrial livestock production: fermentation in the animal gut, manure management, and fodder production. We found that oysters release no methane (CH4) and only negligible amounts of nitrous oxide (0.00012 ± 0.00004 μmol N2O gDW–1 hr–1) and carbon dioxide (3.556 ± 0.471 μmol CO2 gDW–1 hr–1). Further, sediment fluxes of N2O and CH4 were unchanged in the presence of oyster aquaculture, regardless of the length of time it had been in place. Sediment CO2 release was slightly stimulated between 4 and 6 years of aquaculture presence and then returned to baseline levels but was not significantly different between aquaculture and a control site when all ages of culture were pooled. There is no GHG-release from oyster fodder production. Considering the main drivers of GHG-release in terrestrial livestock systems, oyster aquaculture has less than 0.5% of the GHG-cost of beef, small ruminants, pork, and poultry in terms of CO2-equivalents per kg protein, suggesting that shellfish aquaculture may provide a a low GHG alternative for future animal protein production compared to land based sources. We estimate that if 10% of the protein from beef consumption in the United States was replaced with protein from oysters, the GHG savings would be equivalent to 10.8 million fewer cars on the road.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-13 05:27:12,"dh6h8c","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,6,NA,"New Study shows how eating more oysters could reduce greenhouse gas emissions",0.88,6,0,2019-10-13 05:26:04,2019-10-13

**Significance**

Climate change—especially accelerated warming and drying—threatens to increase extinction risk, yet there is little evidence that physiological limitations have contributed to species declines. This study links species-specific water requirements for cooling body temperature to the collapse of a Mojave Desert bird community over the past century from climate change. Species occupying the hottest, driest sites were less likely to persist. Birds with the greatest water requirements for cooling their body temperature experienced the largest declines. Large-bodied carnivores and insectivores were especially vulnerable to cooling costs because they obtain water primarily from their food. Climate warming increases the evaporative cooling demand for birds, which will affect geographic patterns in body size and future extinction risk.

**Abstract**

Climate change threatens global biodiversity by increasing extinction risk, yet few studies have uncovered a physiological basis of climate-driven species declines. Maintaining a stable body temperature is a fundamental requirement for homeothermic animals, and water is a vital resource that facilitates thermoregulation through evaporative cooling, especially in hot environments. Here, we explore the potential for thermoregulatory costs to underlie the community collapse of birds in the Mojave Desert over the past century in response to climate change. The probability of persistence was lowest for species occupying the warmest and driest sites, which imposed the greatest cooling costs. We developed a general model of heat flux to evaluate whether water requirements for evaporative cooling contributed to species’ declines by simulating thermoregulatory costs in the Mojave Desert for 50 bird species representing the range of observed declines. Bird species’ declines were positively associated with climate-driven increases in water requirements for evaporative cooling and exacerbated by large body size, especially for species with animal-based diets. Species exhibiting reductions in body size across their range saved up to 14% in cooling costs and experienced less decline than species without size reductions, suggesting total cooling costs as a mechanism underlying Bergmann’s rule. Reductions in body size, however, are unlikely to offset the 50 to 78% increase in cooling costs threatening desert birds from future climate change. As climate change spreads warm, dry conditions across the planet, water requirements are increasingly likely to drive population declines, providing a physiological basis for climate-driven extinctions.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-08 07:29:36,"dewo37","avogadros_number",0,4,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"Collapse of desert bird populations likely due to heat stress from climate change",1,11,0,2019-10-08 07:28:45,2019-10-08

I partly just used Shakhova as an example, but she is a good one. In her famous 2008 paper, Natalia Shakhova found that a large portion of the methane hydrates in the ESAS (East Siberian Arctic Shelf) were unstable. She had observational evidence for this. When she came back, she was almost ridiculed by the scientific community as models had shown that these hydrates were not unstable. And there came an interesting conundrum of observations Vs models. As Dr Peter Wadhams, another Arctic expert said, observational evidence shod be the gold standard in this case. So, Natalia Shakhova found that these hydrates were, and I quote, ""highly possible for abrupt release at any time"".

The reason why doesn't really matter (it can do as it can change the speed of release but still), it matters that methane will be released.

Edit: Also, we have evidence that warming is having a large impact on the these methane hydrates, causing them to disassociate.

&gt;the methane release is nowhere near as much as they claimed

Shakhova wrote a paper discussing the issues in other papers that discuss methane release from the Arctic. I will link it if you like. There was a lot of talk that the methane release would be so deep, no methane would enter the atmosphere.

I will go into more detail, but she is an amazing example of how a life's work has been almost disregarded by the scientific community due to a skewed method of evaluation.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law is based on the idea that the Earth acts as a [black body.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) This means that it is simplified to act as a perfect absorber of energy. This is on a large scale a really decent approximation to make. It is also derived under the assumption that energy into the earth = energy that is radiated by the Earth, which is another huge assumption. In fact, this is generally true averaged over a long period of time but often (if ever) true on a day to day basis. Under those assumptions, you're right in saying that a hot Earth is better at transferring heat/energy into space. However, the climate system is much more complicated than a broad and simplifying law. It depends on everything from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to cloud cover and the water cycle. (you can read more about Earth's energy budget [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget) \- there is even a good info-graph) I'm not personally sure if you are correct as day-to-day (and nightly) averages go but there are more accurate equations out there to describe Earth's climate than the S-B law.

"f2ifju0",6,"I think you have the hit at a very vital bit of the IPCC's conservative nature, but there is a crux of the issue. The IPCC determines the credibility of a theory in climate science by essentially seeing how many papers have been published on it, and that is terrible!

For example, Natalia Shakhova has dedicated her career to studying methane release in the Arctic. She is THE expert in this field. But seeing as there are only a few papers, it isn't considered by the IPCC.

The most important theories will be as a result of a life's work. Someone may have gotten their PhD in a niche, and spend their life studying that niche. Therefore there will only be a few papers on them, but therefore it's a weak theory according to the IPCC.

I do agree that economists should be left out of the IPCC report in 2021. But I would also like to see them completely restructure their organisation. Possibly with very technocratic departments. For example, if there is a paper that has discovered a new structural fault in an ice sheet, glaciologists can figure out it's credibility. To an extent, that is what already happens, but we need to shift the focus away from the number of papers to the quality of the papers.

Obviously it is not just quantity, but a niche topic with only a handful of papers on it will probably not be considered by the IPCC.

**Abstract**

Supraglacial lakes are important to ice sheet mass balance because their development and drainage has been linked to changes in ice flow velocity and ice shelf disintegration. However, little is known about their distribution on the world’s largest ice sheet in East Antarctica. Here, we use ~5 million km^(2) of high-resolution satellite imagery to identify &gt;65,000 lakes (&gt;1,300 km^(2)) that formed around the peak of the melt season in January 2017. Lakes occur in most marginal areas where they typically develop at low elevations (&lt;100 m) and on low surface slopes (&lt;1°), but they can exist 500 km inland and at elevations &gt;1500 m. We find that lakes often cluster a few kilometres down-ice from grounding lines and ~60% (&gt;80% by area) develop on ice shelves, including some potentially vulnerable to collapse driven by lake-induced hydro-fracturing. This suggests that parts of the ice sheet may be highly sensitive to climate warming.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-04 18:48:35,"ddbld9","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,13,NA,"Freshwater Pools Show Antarctica Is More Vulnerable Than We Thought - East Antarctica’s lakes cluster in patterns similar to those on Greenland’s ice sheet, which is melting rapidly.",0.9,13,0,2019-10-04 18:48:00,2019-10-04

**Abstract**

Earth is heading towards a climate that last existed more than three million years ago (Ma) during the ‘mid-Pliocene warm period’, when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were about 400 parts per million, global sea level oscillated in response to orbital forcing, and peak global-mean sea level (GMSL) may have reached about 20 metres above the present-day value. For sea-level rise of this magnitude, extensive retreat or collapse of the Greenland, West Antarctic and marine-based sectors of the East Antarctic ice sheets is required. Yet the relative amplitude of sea-level variations within glacial–interglacial cycles remains poorly constrained. To address this, we calibrate a theoretical relationship between modern sediment transport by waves and water depth, and then apply the technique to grain size in a continuous 800-metre-thick Pliocene sequence of shallow-marine sediments from Whanganui Basin, New Zealand. Water-depth variations obtained in this way, after corrections for tectonic subsidence, yield cyclic relative sea-level (RSL) variations. Here we show that sea level varied on average by 13 ± 5 metres over glacial–interglacial cycles during the middle-to-late Pliocene (about 3.3–2.5 Ma). The resulting record is independent of the global ice volume proxy (as derived from the deep-ocean oxygen isotope record) and sea-level cycles are in phase with 20-thousand-year (kyr) periodic changes in insolation over Antarctica, paced by eccentricity-modulated orbital precession between 3.3 and 2.7 Ma. Thereafter, sea-level fluctuations are paced by the 41-kyr period of cycles in Earth’s axial tilt as ice sheets stabilize on Antarctica and intensify in the Northern Hemisphere. Strictly, we provide the amplitude of RSL change, rather than absolute GMSL change. However, simulations of RSL change based on glacio-isostatic adjustment show that our record approximates eustatic sea level, defined here as GMSL unregistered to the centre of the Earth. Nonetheless, under conservative assumptions, our estimates limit maximum Pliocene sea-level rise to less than 25 metres and provide new constraints on polar ice-volume variability under the climate conditions predicted for this century.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-04 18:43:19,"ddbipd","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,1,NA,"If warming exceeds 2°C, Antarctica's melting ice sheets could raise seas 20 metres in coming centuries",0.67,1,0,2019-10-04 18:42:26,2019-10-04

**Abstract**

Mega-heatwaves are among the deadliest natural disasters in midlatitudes. During such events, the atmospheric circulation is typically governed by persistent anticyclones, enabling cloud-free conditions and advection of hot air. Dry soils in heatwave regions are also known to further contribute to the escalation of air temperatures. However, while local land–atmosphere feedbacks are well studied, the same does not apply to the influence of upwind areas, from where heat is advected. Here we investigate reanalysis data using a Lagrangian heat-tracking model to unravel the role of upwind land–atmosphere feedbacks during the two European mega-heatwaves of this century: the events in 2003 and 2010. Our analysis indicates that advected sensible heat can come in torrents, suddenly and intensely, leading to abrupt increases in air temperatures that further strengthen local land–atmosphere feedbacks via soil desiccation. During both mega-heatwaves, about 30% of the advected sensible heat was caused by the drought upwind. Since subtropical droughts are projected to aggravate during this century, in light of our results, this may be accompanied by consequent intensification of midlatitude mega-heatwaves. We therefore recommend considering not only local, but also upwind land cover and land-use management in the design of adaptation strategies against compound drought–heatwave events.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-03 04:49:52,"dcm5jt","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,6,NA,"Heat Waves Are Blowing in the Wind - New research indicates that droughts in far-off places contribute to the amount of heat transported to regions experiencing heat waves.",0.81,6,0,2019-10-03 04:48:21,2019-10-03

Quantifying ancient atmospheric pCO2 provides valuable insights into the interplay between greenhouse gases and global climate. Beyond the 800-ky history uncovered by ice cores, discrepancies in both the trend and magnitude of pCO2 changes remain among different proxy-derived results. The traditional paleosol pCO2 paleobarometer suffers from largely unconstrained soil-respired CO2 concentration (S(z)). Using finely disseminated carbonates precipitated in paleosols from the Chinese Loess Plateau, here we identified that their S(z) can be quantitatively constrained by soil magnetic susceptibility. Based on this approach, we reconstructed pCO2 during 2.6–0.9 Ma, which documents overall low pCO2 levels (&lt;300 ppm) comparable with ice core records, indicating that the Earth system has operated under late Pleistocene pCO2 levels for an extended period. The pCO2 levels do not show statistically significant differences across the mid-Pleistocene Transition (ca. 1.2–0.8 Ma), suggesting that CO2 is probably not the driver of this important climate change event.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-02 17:25:10,"dcdddj","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"Humankind Did Not Live With A High-Carbon Dioxide Atmosphere Until 1965 - Earth’s carbon dioxide atmospheric concentrations averaged 230 parts per million for 2.5 million years; today’s levels are about 410 parts per million.",0.83,11,0,2019-10-02 17:24:11,2019-10-02

**Abstract**

Targets and accounting for negative emissions should be explicitly set and managed separately from existing and future targets for emissions reduction. Failure to make such a separation has already hampered climate policy, exaggerating the expected future contribution of negative emissions in climate models, while also obscuring the extent and pace of the investment needed to deliver negative emissions. Separation would help minimize the negative impacts that promises and deployments of negative emissions could have on emissions reduction, arising from effects such as temporal trade-offs, excessive offsetting, and technological lock-in. Benefits for international, national, local, organizational, and sectoral planning would arise from greater clarity over the role and timing of negative emissions alongside accelerated emissions reduction.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-10-02 16:47:14,"dccu18","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,4,NA,"Guest post: The problem with net-zero emissions targets",1,4,0,2019-10-02 16:45:25,2019-10-02

A slightly older paper but a very interesting paper nevertheless, I found it doing research for my upcoming posts on geoengineering.

As the Arctic ice melts, its reflectivity or albedo will decrease. This means that the exposed ocean will warm up more as a result of increased absorption of sunlight. This causes a positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---&gt; Warmer ocean water causes more ice to melt ---&gt; More ice gets melted ---&gt; Rinse and repeat.

However, it was believed that this would create a possible upside. Warmer oceans would allow phytoplankton to grow. As the phytoplankton grows, it will absorb carbon dioxide and therefore cool the earth down slightly. 

This paper shows that increased phytoplankton growth could amplify Arctic warming by 20%, causing devastating warming somewhere that is already warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth. This causes another positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---&gt; Warmer ocean water allows more phytoplankton to grow ---&gt; More phytoplankton growth leads to warmer ocean water and therefore less ice ---&gt; Rinse and repeat.

**Abstract**

The globally averaged calcite compensation depth has deepened by several hundred metres in the past 15 Myr. This deepening has previously been interpreted to reflect increased alkalinity supply to the ocean driven by enhanced continental weathering due to the Himalayan orogeny during the late Neogene period. Here we examine mass accumulation rates of the main marine calcifying groups and show that global accumulation of pelagic carbonates has decreased from the late Miocene epoch to the late Pleistocene epoch even though CaCO3 preservation has improved, suggesting a decrease in weathering alkalinity input to the ocean, thus opposing expectations from the Himalayan uplift hypothesis. Instead, changes in relative contributions of coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera to the pelagic carbonates in relative shallow sites, where dissolution has not taken its toll, suggest that coccolith production in the euphotic zone decreased concomitantly with the reduction in weathering alkalinity inputs as registered by the decline in pelagic carbonate accumulation. Our work highlights a mechanism whereby, in addition to deep-sea dissolution, changes in marine calcification acted to modulate carbonate compensation in response to reduced weathering linked to the late Neogene cooling and decline in atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-09-30 18:12:53,"dbfin3","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,1,NA,"A key theory that attributes the climate evolution of the earth to the breakdown of Himalayan rocks may not explain the cooling over the past 15 million years, according to a Rutgers-led study.",1,1,0,2019-09-30 18:03:08,2019-09-30
"f20cdg5",2,"I was referring to palm oil that is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which requires that no forests yet untouched can be cleared in the supply chain. However, I'm not sure if they also have regulations for peatland, and based on your article it seems like this is all difficult to enforce, due to changing definitions by the Indonesian government. I suppose even palm oil that is produced without clearing forests or peatland still prevents the recovery of previously destroyed land, so I'll revise my statement: try to buy products that contain **no** palm oil. But if you don't have a choice (let's say every brand of shampoo at the store contains palm oil, or something) then at least buy RSPO certified products.

**Disclaimer** \-I don't want to get into debating the merits of geoengineering, this is just to get a better understanding of climate science framed in a geoengineering hyptothetical.

If Elon Musk diverted his attention from putting people on Mars to placing a relatively large controllable satellite lens or group of satellite lenses in geosynchronous orbit close to the sun (say, in the planet Mercury's orbital path):

A) how much light would these need to let pass though to offset 450 ppm CO2 warming down to 350 ppm? In other words, is there a W/M^(2) 'coefficient' from incoming long-wave radiation transfer to GHG affecting short wave radiation, averaged across the different surfaces of the earth? For example,350 is 77.77% of 450, so would this hypothetical lens need to block 22.23% of incoming solar radiation to achieve the effect of dropping from 350 ppm to 450 ppm?

B) Photosynthesis requires long spectrum radiation (blue light) that not even clouds can block. Would blocking a certain amount of this incoming light reduce plant and algae CO2 uptake enough that it would neutralize any positive benefits from preventing this light from becoming short-wave radiation on earth? Is there more incoming long spectrum radiation than plants can use per square cm of leaf surface? I realize most of this long wave radiation is reflected or absorbed as heat by the surface of the earth: this is a question of do plants get more light than they need, so that as planetary thermostat managers we could afford to block a little incoming sunlight without sacrificing too much food production, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services?

c) Would blocking incoming long wave radiation produce changes to weather patterns due to less differential heating from the equator to the poles? Assuming the lens is uniformly transparent, would this be a problem?","Space parasol thought experiment",1,2,0,2019-09-30 11:05:40,2019-09-30

There's a reason that the IPCC's 2022 report is going to be the first to include solar particle forcing data — using the recent relative data set that's been available for a couple years now — which many climate scientists around the world have already analyzed and put forth arguments that suggest overlooking solar particle forcing (along with cosmic rays and the most recent cloud data) has done a great disservice to the field.

A bit of an old one, but it seems every interesting. As you all hopefully know, DMS (dimethylsulphide) essentially cools the atmosphere. DMS is produced by phytoplankton, this study shows that due to ocean acidification (OA), DMS production will decrease, causing an increase in temperature up to 0.48°C.

As you can see in the graph above my text, the trend might either be very sharp, or more shallow, a more dramatic drop might be very bad, meaning that OA will cause a large decrease in DMS and thus a boost to global warming.


This is an interesting mechanism, not included by current models.

However, the jury is still out, this paper shows that while OA will decrease DMS production, warming will increase it.

https://www.biogeosciences.net/16/1167/2019/

This paper shows that OA will decrease DMS concentrations in surface waters.

www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN18186

Edit: Corrected the source

This paper shows that due to Arctic ice loss, DMS production is increasing in the Arctic

https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/09/04/1904378116

Lastly, this paper shows that this may cause a negative feedback in the Arctic.

Infrared radiation of heat.

I build homes in the mtn of Colorado 

We are one of the climates that show temp changes more intensely than others.
Being high altitude and low humidity we experience night sky radiation at very high rates.
A surface that is exposed to the sky at night, like a roof, can get far cooler than ambient temperature.
The heat from a given surface is radiated to space per thermo dynamics. We see this all the time with dew point as well, the roof of a car will cool to see or frost point before the sides.
The gh effect of co2 is at it's full potential when there is little moisture in the air.
For us, the humify has stayed low but the co2 has increased. 
We have seen a tremendous change in our typical cold winter weather. 
30 years ago we routinely had cold snaps that stayed 20 or 30 below zero. 

Now we seldom see 20 below.
Is there any chance that this change in nightly lows is an isolated effect of atmospheric co2 or does it just blend in with the planet climate as a whole.

"f1ckc9g",5,"&gt;Why dose the ocean absorb co2 sometimes and release it during others.  Both situations being a warming ocean.

Because the current global warming is being cause by extra CO2 released in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is thus saturated in CO2 relative to the ocean and so the ocean has to absorb some of it to reach equilibrium. However, the rate at which it absorbs CO2 is slightly slowed by the fact that the oceans themselves are warming and warmer oceans hold less dissolved gas. In the end, human emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere wins out that battle and so in the net, the oceans are still taking up CO2. It is thought that this could swing the other way and the ocean could become a net source of CO2 if human emissions decline but the ocean continues to warm.

The case of ice age cycling from a cold climate to a warm climate is different. There, the initial perturbation is not the emission of fossil fuel CO2 but instead perturbing a state from equilibrium by a slow warming due to changes in Earth's orbit. This slow warming eventually causes a warming of the ocean, which outgasses some of its CO2, which leads to more warming, etc (it's a positive feedback).","climate_science",2019-09-24 21:09:37,"d8ppan","[deleted]",0,5,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,12,"One of the arguments against acc is the lack of temperature increases in the troposphere.

"f1bx01k",13,"Greenhouse theory says troposphere should warm, the stratosphere should cool. However:

&gt;Sat temps say its flat...

That's not correct, (even if it is a constant talking point on in the skepticsphere). You might have seen skeptics' plots that ended about 5-10 years ago? In any case, let's plot the satellite data up to August 2019 (the most recent available).

We can even do as skeptics do and start the trend from the unprecedented El Niño warm year 1998 (not a correct thing to do). Even so, there is still a warming trend in both the RSS and UAH datasets (the two most common satellite datasets).

[https://i.imgur.com/JE1bGvt.png](https://i.imgur.com/JE1bGvt.png)

I've listed the raw data sources below so you can check these trends yourself if you're inclined. 

RSS: [http://images.remss.com/data/msu/graphics/TLT\_v40/time\_series/RSS\_TS\_channel\_TLT\_Global\_Land\_And\_Sea\_v04\_0.txt](http://images.remss.com/data/msu/graphics/TLT_v40/time_series/RSS_TS_channel_TLT_Global_Land_And_Sea_v04_0.txt)

The next question might be: why is there a different trend rate between the two satellite datasets? 

Although there is a lot of assumptions that go into modelling the temperature seen from satellites (you can read the details on RSS [here](http://www.remss.com/measurements/upper-air-temperature/) and UAH [here](https://www.drroyspencer.com/2015/04/version-6-0-of-the-uah-temperature-dataset-released-new-lt-trend-0-11-cdecade/), I think the main difference might be that UAH captures higher up in the troposphere, and even some of the stratosphere (which is cooling) hence has lower warming trend. [See the black line](https://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/MSU2-vs-LT23-vs-LT.gif) from the UAH documentation... although I have yet to see a direct comparison with RSS.","climate_science",2019-09-24 17:07:37,"d8ppan","matmyob",0,13,0,TRUE,2012-01-30 13:19:01,0,0,2823,10645,13468,12,"One of the arguments against acc is the lack of temperature increases in the troposphere.

"f1akqjc",1,"Are you doubting the capacity for change or the ability to adapt for the survival of mankind?

.....that was my initial reaction and based on that, it’s safe to say this is a mad man’s edict. 

Hydroelectric power has been stalled again and again; however the theory remains with untapped potential. I, along with the masses, don’t posses the capacity or capability to construct these possibilities.

You do recall correctly that hydroelectric power is far smaller in real life than my theory. We are talking GLOBAL change, but first we need a working project. With governments flaking on major projects after promising millions, just to see them fail, it’s hard to evaluate. I’ll reply with the link tomorrow. Scotland made bold statements regarding their future projects and ambitions to Achieve pure sustainable energy sources. Including hydroelectric power...I’m loving it. (I don’t eat at McDeforestation of the Amazon rainforest, the line just fit).

Hydroelectric power - chew on it! The tides are constant. The Gulf Stream and others are constant. Think of the feats made which were thought impossible only years prior!! Routing the energy to a major city like NYC - that’s ONE step...

Environmental impact? Mf listen, we can incorporate a layer of filters of varying sizes and mediums to filter out ocean life with minimal impact AND eliminate the need for dependency on batteries that don’t exist to match this framework. (Batteries mentioned here against the main argument for solar or wind for harnessing energy during the “low” periods)

Rather than the idea to dismantle the nuclear arsenal (reduce the enrichment from 90+% to 5%) and fuel a city like LA for a decade (I can provide the link with math tomorrow) let’s look at a long term solution. For the 2000 nukes in US arsenal (deployed, another 2000 reserve) it would fuel LA for 7.8 year according to a Stanford study.  

More realistic and sustainable,

Water is literally essential to life - not to quote Zoolander. But we have to harness this sustainable resource if possible rather than burning coal to dissipate the atmosphere. 

Focus on TESTING and SUPPORTING hydroelectric experiments in terms of GLOBAL SOLUTIONS rather than fighting wars over our ever-decreasing oil reserves. 

Combine hydroelectric power on the waters to assist with wind farms and solar tech, use what Earth provides rather than depleting the planet. 

Thank you for supporting my energy!! no need to debate my delivery. I’m no face of a movement or voice of inspiration but surely a far more educated individual can invoke change or test these ideas!

I find that this argument leans on the false premise that there are a set of agents which are the cause of a problem, and if these agents are neutralised or tweaked, the problem goes away. 

My problem with this narrative is that the global climate is a vast complex system with many interlinkages between other systems like society and ecosystems, and many emergent patterns that we do not understand. Trying to turn an unknown set of knobs on such a system is foolish at least, and dangerous, if you see what fast paced tiny changes can have for disastrous effects on ecosystems we depend on.

Engineering in complex systems (assuming that we can) is very likely to give you many different effects, some of which you do intend, and some of which you do not intend, and some that you might not even be able to observe, because of limited understanding of these systems.","climate_science",2019-09-22 00:03:45,"d7ceyh","grimelda",0,2,0,TRUE,2012-03-24 13:58:37,0,0,180,6281,6461,44,"I will go back to the peer-reviewed papers about climate change if not.

"f0z11ml",5,"Here are my misgivings about global-scale, techno-centric geo-engineering: 

1. We don’t actually know what we’re doing. And honestly I’m not sure we can get there. Why? Global climate systems are intricately tied into myriad global ecological, chemical, and physical systems. I fact, those three comprise what we call “climate”. We do not, and I would argue, adequately understand all the direct and indirect consequences of tinkering with those systems. 

The risk: accidentally making things worse, at a global scale. And not being able to “fix it”. So many ecological systems are already under tremendous strain, I’m concerned such an “accident” could tip more species and ecosystems into catastrophic crashes, which would ultimately harm people (not to mention plant and animal) in unprecedented ways. 

2. Hubris. I argue that we,as a species, need to stop thinking and acting like the natural world is something we can or should control. Not only because it’s not realistic, but also because the costs of managing and administering the system outpace our efforts fast. Case study: our current predicament. Read up on some Victorian era opinions about “improving the natural world” for additional details. Also, it’s not just a western phenomenon, but that’s a whole course in “philosophies of nature”, which I recommend if you have the opportunity. 

3. Simple opportunity cost. Large scale geo-engineering would take a tremendous amount of resources. I’ve never seen a proposal that would not, regardless of what a sales narrative might claim. I argue that there are better uses of those resources for both climate mitigation and general human well being. Anyone selling these solutions could become very very wealthy, and frankly the last thing we need are more billionaires. 

Please note that I apply these to technological geo-engineering. Restoring habitat, adjusting industrial systems, and land management practices are large-scale geo-engineering schemes. I would consider them a lot more seriously then some fantabulous new technology with endless possibilities. After all, like the internet itself, endless possibilities include special new hells.","climate_science",2019-09-21 16:35:22,"d7ceyh","SpoonwoodTangle",0,5,0,TRUE,2018-03-29 16:06:45,0,0,15804,65991,81795,44,"I will go back to the peer-reviewed papers about climate change if not.

"f0yq6t4",1,"i think its important to advocate for 100% energy to the public.  but to sit down now and try to figure out the cost of 100% is an absurd task.  solar and batteries both just dropped 90% in price in a decade.  its going to take at least another decade to get to 95% in a small number of countries.  by then, solar+wind+energy storage+smart grid+energy effeicency+etc is going to equal nearly a century's worth of innovation compared to what we have recently experienced.  the rate of innovation is accelerating.  moreover, its not just a few countries working on it.  every single country that matters is installing renewable energy and contributing to R&amp;D  

we literally have supercomputers modeling millions of different chemistries for better storage.  There are so many ways improve storage.

with the technology we have today we could get to 95% renewable energy and save money.  however, the costs are going to fall significantly.

solar industry is brutal.  way more are going to fail than make it.  all the money long-term is going to be in storage and managing the grid.  I cannot begin to explain how simple solar is to manufacture and install.

"f0wpz6z",1,"Sorry for the late response, I just use this post to answer to both of yours if that's ok.  
Yeah you are totally correct that more energy needed than being produced is bullshit. Maybe better would be that the energy equivalent of what was required to produce it, compared to the energy output is not as high as compared to fossil fuel energy.   


And to your comment of 2013 being old sources, I totally agree, but I found different sources from 2018 which more or less seem to agree to the previous findings (there were even more judging by a quick look at the abstracts, but who got the time to read all of them)

  
Zhou, Z., &amp; Carbajales-Dale, M. (2018). Assessing the photovoltaic  technology landscape: efficiency and energy return on investment  (EROI). *Energy &amp; Environmental Science*, *11*(3), 603-608

  
this paper looks only at PV technology (specifically searched for it because PV is my concern)   
Fig 3 gives a representation of different PV technology and the EROI factor. On the left with the high balance of system cost scenario, again the relative low EROI values are represented like in other studies.

Here is a website from a german professor who lists the EROI for different PV technology, and the values don't differ too significantly  
[https://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/kev/index.php](https://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/kev/index.php)

Trainer, T. (2018). Estimating the EROI of whole systems for 100%  renewable electricity supply capable of dealing with intermittency. *Energy policy*, *119*, 648-653  
Also very interesting, but not specifically concerned with PV. But the conclusion (which is restricted to Australia of course) basically says that 100% renewable can't function with our current demand.

Hall, C. A., Lambert, J. G., &amp; Balogh, S. B. (2014). EROI of different fuels and the implications for society. *Energy policy*, *64*, 141-152  
Also last but not least, this paper again is older but their discussion at least from 6.4, renewable energy sources and 7 policy implications resonate too well with my concern that maybe technology will not be our salvation this time.

I mean, in Europe the planned solution was to buy emission certificates through the Emission Trading System (ETS). While in principle not a bad idea, a lot of critics are saying that as long as this is not a world wide policy, it doesn't improve anything. As long as there is a world market for fossil fuel, as soon as one nation tries to reduce their usage of fossil fuel, the demand decreases which leads to a lower price which makes it more attractive for other nations.

I mean, this can't be an excuse to say ok, why even bother to change because somebody else is going to pollute anyway? But still, I think a point is being made there. Because the goal should be to reduce emissions and even if america and germany e.g. reduce their emissions, it doesn't really matter if world wide the net emissions doesn't decrease. And considering that even scientists seem to have some concerns about a 100% switch to renewables, we shouldn't..rush it? Because this could lead to (unnecessary?) economic damage? Or even more important, talk about the other side of the equation which is our demand and life style? And even darker and more prohibited to talk about, the amount of people with even more growth expected in the future, which would lead to even more energy demand etc.

IMHO those scenarios in the book could be quite far from accurate - some of them exaggerating in one direction but some in the opposite one (the one with only 50cm sea level rise when we get to 4 degrees is hilarious given how we'll very likely have that before the end of this century about the same time we'll pass 2-2.5C or so).

And to return to the OP question - it is very unclear if any credible scenario could result in melting of ALL ice in Antarctica - there is a vast region about 1000km from the South Pole and almost 1000 km in diameter where the bedrock altitude is about 2000m and total altitude including ice is about 4000m - that ice will never melt in any realistic scenario.

By 2100 climate in Europe and US will be significantly warmer but that will not be the biggest issue, the biggest issue will be that half a billion people or more from other poor regions much, much worse affected will be displaced and will try to get in Europe and US - collapse is not going to a Mad Max dystopian future, collapse is the bedrock of society starting to collapse, starting with what Trump and Brexit are doing right now.","climate_science",2019-09-20 15:15:44,"d5xwpq","outspokenskeptic",0,3,0,TRUE,2014-03-02 10:03:09,10,0,100839,17036,117885,20,"Hello,

"f0nwdv5",1,"about the last source.  that seems more on.  The graph which has the price for solar power tower does not include the latest projects which are being built.  solar thermal plus storage (solar tower) came in at 6.3 cents in chile, and little bit more than that in dubai I think.

here is the chile project, which has excellent solar resources
https://cleantechnica.com/2017/03/13/solarreserve-bids-24-hour-solar-6-3-cents-chile/

the question is can they get solar power powers (solar thermal plus storage) so affordable it works outside of barren deserts.

If I had to bet money.  I would bet on PV plus storage.  PV is so incredibly cheap.  and we have just barely gotten start with batteries FOR ENERGY STORAGE.  

The real money for energy is going to be made in storage and intelligent transmission of energy.  The internet of things is going to be so important in developing a smart grid.  

one other random thing.  offshore wind is going to be a decent size player in energy.  that because its capacity factor is so high.  we are talking 50-70% capacity factor for offshore, compared to 30-50% for onshore.  capacity factor is simply a measure of how often its producing full power.  with 50-70% you are going to need a lot less storage.  offshore is more expensive than onshore for now, but its more valuable because its more consistent.","climate_discussion",2019-09-18 05:08:22,"d4pfv4","klowder42",0,1,0,TRUE,2016-05-28 22:35:44,283,0,10770,22476,33529,20,NA,"Geothermal energy has a surprisingly high potential as a clean energy source, at best it might be able to provide our entire electricity need",1,20,0,2019-09-15 19:45:34,2019-09-15
"f0nvwhx",1,"well, I dont know what to make of these sources.  the idea that it takes more energy to build wind and solar plants than they produce is absurd and its come up numerous times in misinformation.  

its takes very little energy to make a solar panel.  

batteries may be a bit of a different story.  your sources were from 2013 and 2014.  batteries cost about 75% less.  the are twice as dense.  

maybe if you ran a simulation trying to use 100% wind and solar with really old battery technology you get some cooked up results.  I am hesititent to even think the first source is an honest piece of work.  this would be the only possible way it was not complete lies.  applying old data to the future.

we need very little storage to get to 80% renewable.  this will happen completely on its own based upon the market.

I follow renewable energy full time and enjoy answering questions.  solar thermal plus storage will be decent market.  it was almost dead a few years ago, because the price of batteries was falling so fast.  but the price of solar thermal plus storage fell also.  it will be used primarily in deserts.

The solutions project currently plans for 11.5% solar thermal out of a possible 100%. as where solar PV will be 45.8%.  this includes PV solar farms,  PVresidential, and PV commerical/government.

dubai is doing a lot of solar thermal plus storage because they have very little wind resources, but obviously great solar.

This video shows how little storage we really need to get to 80% renewables.

This great video shows us how solar is not that much of an issue and its way overblown.

current 3rd generation solar thermal plus storage heat up salt to about 1000 degrees.  4th generation will heat up ceramic material to about twice that.  they have not yet developed materials that can handle those temperatures without melting yet.  remember this fluid has to go through a pump.

I would not be surprised if solar thermal plus storage was not beat out by batteries though.  probably something better than lithium ion.  the thing about solar PV plus storage is so simple we could train illiterate teenagers to do most of the work.  you can build a gigawatt solar park in 6 months.

From one angle, it is the largest carbon reservoir (38,000 PgC in the ocean vs. 830 PgC in the atmosphere). From another angle, 80% of anthropogenic CO2 will be taken up by the ocean after ~1000 years. So yes, there's a nuance of time scales, but it's certainly the dominant carbon reservoir.

I do agree with you that it's not the easiest one to alter. There's also not a lot of potential for the proposed solutions (deep ocean CO2 injection and iron fertilization). Blue carbon is probably the safest and most straight forward, but only has a sequestration potential of roughly 0.1PgC/yr, which is tiny relative to the anthropogenic emissions of 10+ PgC/yr.

"ezza9bf",0,"Thank you for not dismissing this immediately! Brainstorming is indeed important!

I’m not an earth scientist (more of a philosopher, if anything), but i would say that we need at least three things: store, pressure and release.  We’re already storing the CO2, so I guess that leaves us with pressure and release. 

What i was thinking about is the possibility of creating something like a giant trumpet that would channel at least some of the CO2 towards the outside of the planet. I even thought it could perhaps be done with all the plastic that we’ve been accumulating, so that we at least put it to good use... There’s even a project collecting plastic waste from the ocean, perhaps a team could arise from this (?), the ones pick up the trash, the others use it for the construction... 

I wonder... What is heavier, CO2 or O2? Because if we could “filter” the CO2 from the O2, we could work with their densities to release more of the toxic elements and keep more of the good ones. Kind of like the way in which the body is able to separate the two when we breathe.. (I guess some of that technology already exists? check [here](https://sciencenordic.com/climate-change-climate-solutions-iceland/the-machine-that-converts-carbon-dioxide-to-stone-in-iceland/1451455))

What i picture is something like a two-chamber construction, where we collect and filter the gases in the first chamber, and a second one where we propel what we want to release into the outside (and just for fun i would make it sound like a fart). I would also imagine that the “filter chamber” would work to keep “alien gases” from coming to the inside of the Earth (?). 

I realize there are many issues in the construction of a giant trumpet made out of trash... At the same time, many groups before us built incredible constructions with much less technology than we have now, so they just found a way to “figure things out”.. How can we figure this out?","climate_science",2019-09-12 10:17:15,"d2zc6e","xteenac",0,0,0,TRUE,2018-09-01 11:27:05,20,0,4130,3740,7890,12,"Seeing as the CO2 levels have been consistently rising within our atmosphere and they are trapped inside our stellar body, is there any way to make the Earth “fart”?

Dry air causes decending air causing a dry air as a feedback effect.  In a warmer world, this effect is stronger.  This expands deserts in general, and should pull the tropical rainbelt to the south over Africa in paricular, because there is more ocean to the South of the equator.

Generally models have Africa getting dryer, but this isn't all that robust of a result because the Indian Ocean upwind is getteng warmer, which incrases moisture flowing into Africa.","climate_science",2019-09-11 17:48:23,"d2d1x0","ShyElf",0,1,0,TRUE,2014-11-14 02:59:39,0,0,26,38408,38434,19,NA,"What impact on Hadley Cells do climate change models predict; will deserts move/expand?",0.95,19,0,2019-09-10 19:37:08,2019-09-10

**Abstract**

The impacts of climate change on crop yields, as projected by a slew of impact assessments carried out since the 1980s, have brought the issue of future food insecurity to the fore. A meta-analysis of ~27 000 data points from studies published over the last four decades reveals that at country level, average impacts of climate change on crop yields up to the 2050s are generally small (but negative) for rice and wheat, and modest for maize, provided farmers adopt practices and technologies such as improved varieties, planting at optimal times, and improved water and fertilizer management. These technologies also have the potential to reduce differences across political, economic and climatic regions. Once these are adopted, climate change may not add significantly to the challenge of food production for the majority of countries except for some potential hotspots distributed around the world. Massive investment, policy, and institutional support will be needed, however, to facilitate adoption and scaling-out of such practices, and to address climatic variability.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-09-05 23:50:54,"d08scf","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,16,NA,"New meta-analysis highlights that a significant increase in investment, policy and institutional support to agricultural adaptation can limit the challenge of climate change to food production till the 2050s.",0.94,16,0,2019-09-05 23:49:54,2019-09-05

They do, which is wonderful.  It also currently costs ~ $1,100/ton for sequestration. Obviously we'll see efficiency gains, but they would have to be significant to bring it within affordable levels. In addition, using waste heat would be interesting to see scaled out to the tens of thousands of plants needed to sequester enough carbon to make a difference. At that scale there *will* be significant impacts due to supply chain management and logistics/resource necessities. 

&gt;Regarding materials, the carbon negativity outweighs the emissions.

Potentially, depending on what energy sources are used, etc (e.g. needs to be 100% renewable, as even NG isn't efficient enough to get a ""net negative"" result). Still, we don't account for most negative environmental externalities - so the cost on the land, water, and biosphere in other ways needs to be considered as well.

**Significance**

One of the greatest challenges in projecting the sea-level contributions of ice sheets over the next century is the lack of observations of conditions within and underneath the ice sheet that span more than a decade or two. By digitizing archival ice-penetrating radar data recorded in the 1970s on 35-mm optical film, we can compare modern and archival radar-sounding data at their full resolution in order to observe changes in the Antarctic ice sheet over more than 40 y. This makes it possible to investigate and model subsurface processes over both large scales and several decades for the first time.

**Abstract**

Airborne radar sounding can measure conditions within and beneath polar ice sheets. In Antarctica, most digital radar-sounding data have been collected in the last 2 decades, limiting our ability to understand processes that govern longer-term ice-sheet behavior. Here, we demonstrate how analog radar data collected over 40 y ago in Antarctica can be combined with modern records to quantify multidecadal changes. Specifically, we digitize over 400,000 line kilometers of exploratory Antarctic radar data originally recorded on 35-mm optical film between 1971 and 1979. We leverage the increased geometric and radiometric resolution of our digitization process to show how these data can be used to identify and investigate hydrologic, geologic, and topographic features beneath and within the ice sheet. To highlight their scientific potential, we compare the digitized data with contemporary radar measurements to reveal that the remnant eastern ice shelf of Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica had thinned between 10 and 33% between 1978 and 2009. We also release the collection of scanned radargrams in their entirety in a persistent public archive along with updated geolocation data for a subset of the data that reduces the mean positioning error from 5 to 2.5 km. Together, these data represent a unique and renewed extensive, multidecadal historical baseline, critical for observing and modeling ice-sheet change on societally relevant timescales.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-09-03 19:11:53,"cz9c6j","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,18,NA,"Newly available archival film has revealed the eastern ice shelf of Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is melting faster than previous estimates, suggesting the shelf may collapse sooner than expected.",0.91,18,0,2019-09-03 19:11:33,2019-09-03

**Abstract**

Reconstructing the evolution of sea level during past warmer epochs such as the Pliocene, provides unique insight into the response of sea level and ice sheets to prolonged warming. While estimates of global mean sea level (GMSL) during this time exist, they vary by several tens of metres, hindering the assessment of past and future ice sheet stability. Here we show that during the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period, which was on average 2–3 °C warmer than pre-industrial, the GMSL was 16.2 m (most likely, 5.6–19.2 m, 68% uncertainty range) higher than today. During the even warmer Pliocene Climatic Optimum (~4 °C warmer than pre-industrial), our results show that GMSL was 23.5 m above present (most probably, 9.0–26.7 m, 68% uncertainty range). We present six GMSL data points, ranging from 4.39 to 3.27 million years ago, that are based on phreatic overgrowths on speleothems from the western Mediterranean (Mallorca, Spain). This record is unique owing to its clear relationship to sea level, its reliable U–Pb ages and its long timespan, which allows us to quantify uncertainties on potential uplift. Our data indicate that ice sheets are very sensitive to warming and provide important calibration targets for future ice sheet models.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-08-31 08:48:51,"cxtq0j","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,12,NA,"Scientists discover evidence for past high-level sea rise at current atmospheric carbon dioxide levels",1,12,0,2019-08-31 08:47:10,2019-08-31

**Abstract**

In the last two decades Europe experienced a series of high‐impact heat extremes. We here assess observed trends in temperature extremes at ECA&amp;D stations in Europe. We demonstrate that on average across Europe the number of days with extreme heat and heat stress has more than tripled and hot extremes have warmed by 2.3 °C from 1950–2018. Over Central Europe, the warming exceeds the corresponding summer mean warming by 50%. Days with extreme cold temperatures have decreased by a factor of 2–3 and warmed by more than 3 °C, regionally substantially more than winter mean temperatures. Cold and hot extremes have warmed at about 94% of stations, a climate change signal that cannot be explained by internal variability. The clearest climate change signal can be detected in maximum heat stress. EURO‐CORDEX RCMs broadly capture observed trends but the majority underestimates the warming of hot extremes and overestimates the warming of cold extremes.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-08-29 18:45:22,"cx512i","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,13,NA,"Europe Is Warming Faster Than Even Climate Models Projected",0.86,13,0,2019-08-29 18:44:34,2019-08-29

You don't need to clear it up for me, the paper directly states that the revised RCPs produce higher warming and that our current pathway RCP 4.5, will lead to warming above 2°C.

This paper directly states that there will be more warming than anticipated. And the claim of an ECS value of 3.7°C is still very plausible.

It doesn't just impact ECS, it also changes RCPs, this paper, to my knowledge, has not been formally disputed and it shows that our current pathway is one leading to catastrophic warming of 3°C.

"eyarfwa",5,"ECS estimates such as the paper OP posted tend to jump around a good bit (for multitudes of reasons.) Not even a [few months later](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25450) another study came around and showed it was outside of their (lower) projected estimates.  The one in question projects higher warming primarily due to cloud modeling, which can be very finnicky. (And is a source of trouble in some of the newer models as well.) There's multitudes of papers saying higher and lower, and this is among them.

The best estimate we have still is ~2.5-3C. We will find out more in the AR6 report regarding it, but it hasn't changed very much since 1990, only undergoing one (reverted) revision in 2007. (This paper is likely included in the next report as well!)

I can't give all the answers, but there's a lot we can do, and can be done. The bulk of fossil fuels are still in the ground, and, most importantly- we're just getting started.

Numerous groups have been fighting for climate action and winning battles, there's been a dramatic shift in discourse on climate in the past year alone, and people are rising up to the challenge. Fast enough, perhaps not, but they're gaining more momentum. (See Fridays for Future/Citizen's Climate Lobby/350.org/The Global Climate Strike/Extinction Rebellion- just to name a few.) Joining up with any of them is a good way to combat despair. (And are what a lot of the scientists say has reinvigorated them.) This isn't a comprehensive list of everything, but it's a few of the big ones.

For work being done, check a few of the other climate subreddits, as there's a lot going on each day. /r/ClimateActionPlan and /r/ClimateOffensive for things being done &amp; activism respectively.

I also would suggest checking out the list of 2,600+ scientists who deal with climate here:

[https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/lists/scientists-who-do-climate](https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/lists/scientists-who-do-climate)

They talk a lot about actions, politics, what's going on, and what we can do, and are a wealth of information in trying times. I have a list of recommendations of a few scientists &amp; activists [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/cmysgi/weekly_discussion_thread_august_4_2019/ew6g621/?context=3).

"eya8b7a",4,"Been keeping tabs on this thread since I was tagged in it repeatedly.

So, I actually checked into this paper about a week or so ago, and it's relating to a sensitivity difference from what I gathered. (More on that in the scientist comments below!)

&gt;Thus, in an effort to make the present work comparable to previous research, we also show the results of our procedure applied to a predictand of ECS values6. We find that the observationally informed ECS prediction has a mean value of 3.7 °C (with a 25–75% interval of 3.0 °C to 4.2 °C) and that 68% of the observationally informed distribution of ECS is above the raw model mean of 3.1 °C (Fig. 2e).

(for one reference!)

Carbon Brief discussed it 'briefly' in [this article](https://www.carbonbrief.org/new-study-reduces-uncertainty-climate-sensitivity), which also talks about another paper that was released after regarding lower ECS/sensitivity, and has comments from Brown from this paper.

Here's also a [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/12/06/the-most-accurate-climate-change-models-predict-the-most-alarming-consequences-study-claims/) with many comments from other scientists &amp; the authors about it.

More or less, it's about uncertainty (and as a result, our modeling, especially with clouds) but also helps provide a better picture overall. As always, more data is needed! 

There's also more nitty gritty from Brown's own website [here](https://patricktbrown.org/2017/11/29/greater-future-global-warming-inferred-from-earths-recent-energy-budget/), where he delves into it more.","climate_science",2019-08-28 02:33:51,"cw1roe","ClimateNurse",0,4,0,TRUE,2019-07-15 08:54:15,0,0,328,2518,2846,38,"An open-source, incredibly alarming paper in which their projection for RCP 4.5 has the same warming as the previous RCP 6.0.

They are outdated, which makes them conservative, because the publish papers periodically, the science ""evolves"".

RCPs are brilliant, but they can be used for more than the IPCC give them credit.

Fine, whatever. They used data at the time, but that still means that they are conservative, maybe they weren't when they published, but they are now.

There's a wealth of information on permafrost that's new, choosing to use slightly outdated science, while touting the IPCC is conservative is indicative of your stance. You really just like Shakhova. It's actually quite ironic.

Shakhova used observational evidence to prove that part of the methane reservoir was unstable, newer papers used models, who do we believe, models or observational data?

I don't really stand by Shakhova's claim that methane release could be instantaneous or that all 50GT would enter the atmosphere, but we know that part is unstable.

"ey8ngcw",1,"\&gt;I only know of one of his predictions, but I may be wrong. And ai don't care about his predictions, I care about his years of expertise.

Well his predictions are indicative of his expertise, so choosing to forget that is willful ignorance.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; But we know that the IPCC is too conservative on this front. GAC likelihood proves this. 

Conservative? No. Outdated? A little. Only recently has research picked up to really show that the IPCC is off a bit on SLR, but even then it's not *wildly* inaccurate. It's a bit conservative in some aspects (or outdated pick your poison) like methane release from permafrost, SLR, and the various effects of climate change like heatwaves. Not listening to the IPCC as conservative because they're a bit outdated or a tad conservative is probably one of the worst things you could do, because even with these conservative aspects they aren't wildy wrong, so their RCPs and the Models are still *really fucking good.* Could they be more accurate? Of course! And the next generation certainly will be. But from what we know, the new models aren't wildly different besides ECS which luckily isn't a near term issue.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; So my approval of Wadhams disproved everything I have to say?

\&gt;Read his papers, you will see that he is the expert, if your knowledge of Wadhams comes from the media:

Key word: Almost. If you actually read what I said, it doesn't make me ignore your opinion. And once again if you decided to read my words instead of assuming I haven't looked into Wadhams, I stated that he still generally knows what he's talking about of course. Just that using his predictions as evidence is underwhelming to say the very least.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; But the models are the most important, and even then, they don't include all the feedbacks, and they downplay them.

Once again a misrepresentation of the science. They didn't downplay them, they used the information available. And *even then* with these additions it's not like they're wildly inaccurate, so using these as evidence that the IPCC is just flat out wrong is asinine. And while the models are important you were convinced that the RCPs are just not worth much stock which is inaccurate. They have their issues of course, but you overplay them.

I think the IPCC made the correct decision when not using Shakhovas work in some aspects, and I think it makes sense considering what little research has not been indicative of an inevitable or likely major issue.

&gt;For many of us, the thundering onset of climate change is what woke us from our slumber. That is the hardest to ignore. The latest comprehensive view from the deeply conservative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) went something like this: 

&gt;**“Within the next 12 years, we just need to put aside all our differences and peacefully orchestrate a massive and abrupt slow-down of the world’s economy without destroying it. Meanwhile, we need to pull carbon out of the air with gadgets that haven’t been invented yet, or we’re fucked.”**

&gt;Maybe I shouldn’t have tried to make a living by campaigning on climate change. **Anyone who has made any serious attempt at following the logic through realises we are actually campaigning against industrial colonialist civilisation. For anybody in the industrialised world, this is the source of all our wealth. It’s what pays all our wages.

____

**Abstract**

The Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT), approximately 34 Ma ago, marks a period of major global cooling and inception of the Antarctic ice sheet. Proxies of deep circulation suggest a contemporaneous onset or strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Proxy evidence of gradual salinification of the North Atlantic and tectonically driven isolation of the Arctic suggest that closing the Arctic-Atlantic gateway could have triggered the AMOC at the EOT. We demonstrate this trigger of the AMOC using a new paleoclimate model with late Eocene boundary conditions. The control simulation reproduces Eocene observations of low Arctic salinities. Subsequent closure of the Arctic-Atlantic gateway triggers the AMOC by blocking freshwater inflow from the Arctic. Salt advection feedbacks then lead to cessation of overturning in the North Pacific. These circulation changes imply major warming of the North Atlantic Ocean, and simultaneous cooling of the North Pacific, but no interhemispheric change in temperatures.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-08-25 23:02:49,"cvfnvz","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"Switching on the Atlantic heat pump - Scientists find a new trigger to explain the start-up of the Atlantic current system during the greenhouse-icehouse climate transition 34 million years ago.",1,11,0,2019-08-25 23:01:13,2019-08-25

"exrnspa",1,"On average, there is no positive outcome, to my eye, with hastily dumping energy into the climate.

Most notably, global climate is lead by the oceanic expression of thermal energy which they have previously absorbed.  It that regard, the Pacific Ocean is the most influential.  The pacific decadal oscillation (including effects like El Nino and La Nina) is evident in global temperature records, steering them like a rudder according to 'warm' and 'cool' phases, wherein warmer and cooler currents shift to the surface.

The surface temperatures of the oceans are directly connected to their cloud cover, which in turn modulates the greenhouse effect and how much sunlight reaches the surface.  Our understanding of changes in cloud cover are untenably uncertain, past, present, future; and clouds remain the primary reason for the diversity of models and predictions.

So, there remains a significant possibility that the mystery of cloud cover conceals the sensitivity of our climate, representing a far more consequential future than what the average climatologist expects.  In conjunction with the beginning of the 'warm phase' of the PDO (\~2035), there is a significant possibility that we'll be coming to terms with an unexpectedly chaotic reaction soon.

"exqlg9w",1,"Study: [Radiokrypton unveils dual moisture sources of a deep desert aquifer](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/33/16222)

**Significance**

Paleoprecipitation records and subsurface water storage properties are essential data ingredients for accurate hydroclimate and water balance projections. Although both types of data could be extracted from groundwater, their application over long timescales had been limited by the lack of appropriate chronometers. We used a long-lived radiokrypton isotope and identified two distinct moisture source contributions to a deep desert aquifer from low eccentricity periods, one recent and the other 360 ky ago. The groundwater recharge periods show the sensitivity of the moisture transport processes to orbital forcing, whereas the long storage reflects subsurface flow attenuation exerted by faults. Krypton-81 enables groundwater to serve as a direct record of paleoprecipitation over land and of subsurface water storage for the past 1,300 ky.

**Abstract**

In arid regions, groundwater is a vital resource that can also provide a long-term record of the regional water cycle. However, the use of groundwater as a paleoclimate proxy has been limited by the complex hydrology and the lack of appropriate chronometers to determine the recharge time without complication. Applying  ⁸¹Kr, a long-lived radioisotope tracer, we investigate the paleohydroclimate and subsurface water storage properties of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer in the Negev Desert, Israel. Based on the spatial distributions of stable isotopes and the abundance of  ⁸¹Kr, we resolve subsurface mixing and identify two distinct moisture sources of the recharge: one recent (&lt;38 ky ago) from the Mediterranean and the other 361 ± 30 ky ago from the tropical Atlantic, both of which occurred under conditions of low orbital eccentricity comparable to that of the present. The recent recharge provided by the moisture from Mediterranean cyclones can be attributed to the southward shift of the storm track during the Last Glacial Maximum, and the earlier recharge can be attributed to moisture from the Atlantic delivered as tropical plumes under a climate colder than the present. Furthermore, the residence time of the latter reveals that tectonically active terrain can store groundwater for an unexpectedly long period, likely due to strongly attenuated groundwater flow across the fault zones. With this tracer, groundwater can now serve as a direct record of paleoprecipitation over land and of subsurface water storage from the mid-Pleistocene and onward.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-08-22 19:58:34,"cu2p7d","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,8,NA,"The Dawning of the Age of Old Aquifers - A new technique using ⁸¹Kr can measure the age of old groundwater in arid regions.

**Abstract**

Methane has been rising rapidly in the atmosphere over the past decade, contributing to global climate change. Unlike the late 20th century when the rise in atmospheric methane was accompanied by an enrichment in the heavier carbon stable isotope (13C) of methane, methane in recent years has become more depleted in ^(13)C. This depletion has been widely interpreted as indicating a primarily biogenic source for the increased methane. Here we show that part of the change may instead be associated with emissions from shale-gas and shale-oil development. Previous studies have not explicitly considered shale gas, even though most of the increase in natural gas production globally over the past decade is from shale gas. The methane in shale gas is somewhat depleted in ^(13)C relative to conventional natural gas. Correcting earlier analyses for this difference, we conclude that shale-gas production in North America over the past decade may have contributed more than half of all of the increased emissions from fossil fuels globally and approximately one-third of the total increased emissions from all sources globally over the past decade.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-08-15 17:23:27,"cqssl8","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,8,NA,"As methane concentrations increase in the Earth’s atmosphere, chemical fingerprints point to a probable source: shale oil and gas - About two-thirds of all new gas production over the last decade has been shale gas produced in the United States and Canada",1,8,0,2019-08-15 17:12:34,2019-08-15

**Abstract**

We juxtapose 386 prominent contrarians with 386 expert scientists by tracking their digital footprints across ∼200,000 research publications and ∼100,000 English-language digital and print media articles on climate change. Projecting these individuals across the same backdrop facilitates quantifying disparities in media visibility and scientific authority, and identifying organization patterns within their association networks. Here we show via direct comparison that contrarians are featured in 49% more media articles than scientists. Yet when comparing visibility in mainstream media sources only, we observe just a 1% excess visibility, which objectively demonstrates the crowding out of professional mainstream sources by the proliferation of new media sources, many of which contribute to the production and consumption of climate change disinformation at scale. These results demonstrate why climate scientists should increasingly exert their authority in scientific and public discourse, and why professional journalists and editors should adjust the disproportionate attention given to contrarians.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-08-15 04:05:52,"cqkwt2","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,19,NA,"""Climate change contrarians"" are getting 49 per cent more media coverage than scientists who support the consensus view that climate change is man-made, a new study has found.",0.96,19,0,2019-08-15 04:05:20,2019-08-15

The paper, the scientists, and the finding requires much more evidence before it can be accepted as truth, the fact that it doesn't line up with history isn't great, and it doesn't line Cox et Al 2018's constraint also doesn't help. It really doesn't line up with any method of quantifying ECS.

&gt;The CESM2 ECS is 5.3K, diagnosed with SOM simulations, an increase of over 1K from CESM1. Higher ECS in CESM2 compared to CESM1 appears to be a consequence of changes to cloud feedbacks and altering ACI to match the 20th century temperature record, which also impacted feedbacks.

(lines 331-333)

&gt;Cloud feedbacks are the cause of increased ECS in CESM2. But the cloud distri  
&gt;  
&gt;357 bution in CESM2 is significantly improved over CESM1 in many ways. CESM2 com  
&gt;  
&gt;358 pares well to observations; better than CESM1 (see supplement), which was already one  
&gt;  
&gt;359 of the ‘better’ models in CMIP5 \[Knutti et al., 2013\]. An ECS of 5.3K would lead to a  
&gt;  
&gt;360 high level of climate change and large impacts. It is imperative that the community work  
&gt;  
&gt;361 in a multi-model context to understand how plausible such a high ECS is. What scares us  
&gt;  
&gt;362 is not that the CESM2 ECS is wrong (all models are wrong, Box \[1976\]), but that it might  
&gt;  
&gt;363 be right.

It's a little too early to base anything off of this, as it's still a work-in-progress, and it seems to be related to new features- we'll find out more when these are solidified and released together w/ the CMIP6/AR6 in 2021.  We need more data in the end, as this goes against what we've known about ECS in the current time period.

"ewosnvl",2,"Yes, to the extent that it slowed freshwater export, it would warm the NH by speeding up the AMOC.

Their project doesn't seem likely to slow down export much.  Given how wide Fram Strait it is, it would just mostly just push the ice to the east a bit.  If the effect was just that ice just held together longer, more freshwater would arrive at the downwelling zone, leading to a cooling effect instead.  If you wanted to slow down ice circulation Nares would be a better choice, since it's jammed with ice much of the time.

Also, the direct effect of a fresher Arctic ocean would be more ice and a cooling effect.

CESM2 seems to have the AMOC as a global cooling effect, with it being associated with fewer El Nino events, and less positive low level cloud feedback in the eastern tropical Pacific. Hence decreasing AMOC seems to be a positive feedback.

Their costs for the full application they simulate seem to be around $50B/year, taking their numbers and ignoring the ""last mile"" costs which ought to be the largest part of the cost.

It's not clear how effective the albedo reduction should be in general, given that the thin glass spheres should be buried in snow much of the time, ought to serve as a site for plant colonization, and may be crushed by ice which regularly crushes large steel ships.

"ewgo3ph",11,"These are good questions, and can be estimated pretty easily.

Electrical/gas/oil etc: just add up the total global energy we consume each year and make the assumption that it all breaks down into waste heat released into the atmosphere as sensible heat (pretty reasonable), then:

5.67E20 \[Joules per year\] / (60\*60\*24\*365 \[seconds\]) = 1.8E13 Watts

Over the surface of the Earth (5.1E14 m2), that's: 0.035 W/m2

As for human metabolism: each person puts out about 150W. So with 7.5B people, that's: 150\*1.5E9 = 1.125E12 Watts

Then with global surface area 5.1E14 m2 thats: 0.0022 W/m2

So together, that's 0.0375 W/m2.

Compare that with the amount of radiative forcing from additional heat from anthropogenic greenhouse gasses, which is about 2.5 W/m2, then you see that the actual heat generated from human activities is pretty small when spread over the Earth (about 1.5% of energy compared with GHG warming). That's not to say it's insignificant, because the great majority of this energy gets released into cities, which make up about 2% of the Earths surface. So in a city, the extra output from us being there (energy use and metabolism) is equal (in order of magnitude) to global warming forcing! So that's pretty interesting!

**TLDR**: human caused heat globally is about 1.5% of energy compared with greenhouse gasses, but significant in cities.

Edit: oh, you were also comparing it to the energy from the sun? That is on average about 340 W/m2 (including night time and a spherical Earth), so human-caused heat is about 10,000 times less energy than the average received from the sun.","climate_science",2019-08-09 21:32:04,"co7afr","matmyob",0,11,0,TRUE,2012-01-30 13:19:01,0,0,2823,10645,13468,6,"In the discussion about climate change, only heat-trapping gases seem to enter the discussion.

"ewckwr6",3,"This criticism is somewhat off the mark- the report itself doesn't state that there is a high likliehood of civilizational collapse or extinction by 2050. Instead it includes this statement:

&gt;&gt;A 2017 survey of  global catastrophic risks by the Global Challenges Foundation found that: “In high-end [climate] scenarios, the scale of  destruction is beyond our capacity to model, with a high likelihood of  human civilization coming to an end.”

The Global Challenges survey is being referenced in the context of [extreme heating of over 6 degrees C](https://globalchallenges.org/en/our-work/annual-report/annual-report-2017/catastrophic-climate-change). I'm not sure if this would be considered controversial among most climate scientists, but the World Bank for example has stated that it considers that 4C may be beyond the limit of adaptation. Prof. Hans Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has suggested Earth's carrying capacity under a 4C rise may be less than 1 billion people. 

The report is over 40 pages and extensively footnoted with references to the scientific literature as well as other sources. I'm still reading it and I'm not qualified to speak on whether it misrepresents the science, but it seems on the face of it that much of the criticism aimed at this report is off the mark. 

The report seems to be highlighting risks of low probability, high impact events and argues in favor of a precautionary approach. From what I've read so far it does not make an argument for inevitable or probably near term collapse, but does suggest that *risk* (as the product of likliehood X impact) has been understated in climate communication and policy over the last decades, which has tended to focus on the most likely outcomes while minimizing the danger inherent in the low probability, high impact scenarios.

&gt;The next step is for climate scientists to understand in detail why some of the new models are showing this shift in ECS – and how this fits with other lines of evidence. This includes looking at other measures of sensitivity, including “[transient climate response](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-scientists-estimate-climate-sensitivity)” (TCR), which measures the rate of warming.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The new simulations are only now being discussed at meetings, and not all the numbers are in, so “it’s a bit too early to get wound up,” says John Fyfe, a climate scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria, whose model is among those running much hotter than in the past. “But maybe we have to face a reality in the future that’s more pessimistic than it was in the past.” 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The results so far are “not sufficient to convince me,” says Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. In the effort to account for atmospheric components that are too small to directly simulate, like clouds, the new models could easily have strayed from reality, she says. “That’s always going to be a bumpy road.” 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Even so, the model results remain disconcerting, Gettelman says. The planet is already warming faster than humans can cope with, after all. “The scary part is these models might be right,” he says. “Because that would be pretty devastating.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The new data on aerosol emissions led to a stronger cooling effect in the NCAR model than previous versions. However, the stronger aerosol-related cooling also led to an unrealistic portrayal of 20th century climate. When the model was reconfigured in response, it produced a more accurate reproduction of 20th- and 21st-century climate, including cloud behavior—but with a higher ECS, which pointed to a more ominous portrayal of future change.

So it -may- be higher. More information and data is needed to properly assess this. Especially given the CESM2 models are included in [CMIP6](https://cmip6workshop19.sciencesconf.org/data/CMIP6_CMIP6AnalysisWorkshop_Barcelona_190325_FINAL.pdf).

&gt; The exact implications will only become clear once more analysis work is done using the latest generation climate models. In the meantime, the IPCC’s [special report on 1.5C](https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-ipccs-special-report-on-climate-change-at-one-point-five-c), published last year, remains the most up-to-date and robust assessment of the carbon budgets needed to meet the Paris goals. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“It does indeed look like many of the latest models will have ECS values higher than the IPCC ‘likely range’ of 1.5-4.5°C,” said Peter Cox (University of Exeter) in an email. “It seems that the new models with high ECS have more low-level cloud that tends to burn off under climate change, producing an amplifying feedback on warming.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Cox is lead author of a [2018 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25450) in *Nature* that examined temperature variability around long-term warming. The study concluded that the odds of ECS going outside the long-accepted range of 1.5-4.5°C were very small. “It is worth noting that observational constraints from both the temperature trend and temperature variability still suggest ECS of around 3°C,” said Cox. “So climate science has a conundrum to solve here.”","climate_science",2019-08-07 06:42:48,"cn1zrv","DungeonMastered",0,6,0,TRUE,2018-05-11 04:47:30,0,0,85,823,908,33,NA,"New Models Point to More Global Warming Than We Expected by Bob Henson | Category 6",0.89,33,0,2019-08-07 06:04:23,2019-08-07

"ew4h1kk",7,"Is this in the context of solar radiation management (SRM) via aerosol injection? If so, nay. For several reasons.

Have you seen Chernobyl? Imagine the scene where Jarred Harris' character is explaining why the reactor exploded with the red and blue labels. In this case, the red is increased CO2 increasing heat, and the blue is the aerosols pumped into the air to counter this. Without reducing our use of fossil fuels, CO2 increases, so we have to increase aerosols to account for the increase in trapped solar radiation by reflecting more before it gets trapped. However, aerosols rain out, and need to be continually replenished to maintain the cooling effect. There are also suggestions that their cooling effect is not uniform, and in fact may be nonexistent in some places, and so whichever nation/state/organisation in control of them would probably face massive political pressure (like, climate wars levels of pressure).

If they ever stop injecting aerosols, the ""red labels"" are still there. So we get all the global mean warming that we otherwise would have had, in the space of time it takes for the aerosols to rain out. I.e. in less than a decade. This would be pretty catastrophic.

Add to this the fact that aerosol injection counters only the warming effect of CO2 and not other effects such as ocean acidification and air pollution, it's at best a very very short term band aid while we simultaneously undertake massive carbon capture and storage efforts or at least massive decarbonisation, in my opinion.

&gt; 
&gt; Liar.

[Better call Hansen](http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/CO2Emissions/TimeBomb_wRCPs.pdf) and tell him he's a liar too.  Direct observation also supports us tracking closer to RCP 8.5.  The average CO2 increase per year at Mauna Loa over the last 5 years has been 2.6PPM (and the rate of increase is increasing but we'll just ignore that for now).  1PPM is 2.13 PgC.  Given that 60% is absorbed (IPCC AR5) that implies actual emissions are closer to 13.75 GtC/yr which, oops, puts us slightly *ahead* of RCP 8.5.    Of course the 60% figure is not without its controversy but we must keep in mind that if anything sinks are degrading so that percentage might well shrink.

&gt; So you are cherry picking one source that feeds you what you want.

Wow, I said I've watched everything of his, that's all.  I even read denialist sites just to see IF there's anything to them.  But I like KA because he speaks frankly and broadly.   I gather you disagree with him?  What exactly are *your* credentials?

&gt; None of these sources support your claims.

My claim that the oceans are dying?  Of course not.  That's far too sweeping an assertion for any scientist to make.  But, connecting all the dots (all coral reefs are slated to die, acidification continuing, heating, pollution, etc), I'll say that I think they are going to be effectively dead as far as we've known them.

**Abstract**

Previous studies reconstructed twentieth-century global mean sea level (GMSL) from sparse tide-gauge records to understand whether the recent high rates obtained from satellite altimetry are part of a longer-term acceleration. However, these analyses used techniques that can only accurately capture either the trend or the variability in GMSL, but not both. Here we present an improved hybrid sea-level reconstruction during 1900–2015 that combines previous techniques at time scales where they perform best. We find a persistent acceleration in GMSL since the 1960s and demonstrate that this is largely (~76%) associated with sea-level changes in the Indo-Pacific and South Atlantic. We show that the initiation of the acceleration in the 1960s is tightly linked to an intensification and a basin-scale equatorward shift of Southern Hemispheric westerlies, leading to increased ocean heat uptake, and hence greater rates of GMSL rise, through changes in the circulation of the Southern Ocean.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-08-05 20:06:26,"cmg6a5","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,13,NA,"Global sea level rise began to accelerate in the 1960s, 30 years earlier than suggested by previous assessments, a new study finds.",0.93,13,0,2019-08-05 20:06:02,2019-08-05

Regularly read RealClimate and Arctic Sea Ice forums, CarbonBrief, and about a dozen other blogs/online publications that I consider to be of repute.  I can't count the number of lectures I've watched on YouTube (including everything with Kevin Anderson from whom I came to appreciate the scope of the predicament).  As to the IPCC, I read select sections of interest as time is a finite resource.

Speaking of the IPCC and coral reefs.. From [here](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WGIIAR5-CCboxes_FINAL.pdf):

&gt; Even under optimistic assumptions regarding corals being able to rapidly adapt to thermal stress, one-third (9 to 60%, 68% uncertainty range) of the world’s coral reefs are projected to be subject to long-term degradation (next few decades) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)3-PD scenario (Frieler et al., 2013). Under
the RCP4.5 scenario, this fraction increases to two-thirds (30 to 88%, 68% uncertainty range).

"ew1s2qo",3,"&gt; We were talking about temperature. 

Not exclusively.  I was talking about the health of the oceans and their likelihood of survival in a form usable to humans (of which around 3 billion depend on oceans for their primary source of protein).   We know the coral reefs aren't going to survive in a 2C scenario which I consider to be the bottom end of projections.  We also know that acidification can enter a feedback loop which will likely kill off much of what remains.   We are “at the precipice of excitation,”  if Dr. Rothman is a [good enough source](http://news.mit.edu/2019/carbon-threshold-mass-extinction-0708) for you.  Throw in warming, AMOC slowdown and other insults and it's hard -- for me -- to see ocean life surviving anything like its current degraded form.

&gt;And you think a tractor must have a microchip. Funny how tractors worked before the microprocessorer.

Nowhere did I say a tractor ""must"" have anything.  I specifically said ""modern ag.""  This whole discussion was predicated on the OP saying a few places can hold on as ""technical civilizations"" in the context of a global collapse.  I was trying to make the point that it would be extremely difficult to do so given supply chains.  Unless you think Iceland can just start manufacturing tractors on its own to run on fuel that it does not domestically produce then great.  

&gt;And no Robbert Scribbler and Guy McPherson are not credible sources.

Scribbler is a hobbyist and I appreciate what he's doing even if he gets things wrong from time to time.  I haven't followed anything of his in years though.  I don't read/watch/smell anything with McPherson as I long ago realized he's a hand-waving doomer.

&gt;Thus your lust for disaster.

Very nearly got under my skin there.  You know nothing about me, the effort I'm making to understand as much of the situation as possible, the ongoing grief and sense of despair I have from what I've learned and what I conservatively expect.

"ew14r8c",3,"I would say look at it this way: The growth of the world population since the industrialisation of farming is utterly unprecedented in all of human history. Primarily because of the abundance of food resulting from chemical fertilisers and mechanised (ie..fossil fueled) farming. The current population is already unsustainable if we continue to consume resources at the same rate. So.. add climate pressure reducing the amount of cultivated land, plus mass migration, plus increasing scarcity of resources such as water and energy.. and something will have to give. Based on what was historically possible with pre industrial farming at least 60% of the population will starve if global farming collapses. If there are  enclaves with sufficient technology and a mild enough climate to produce enough food and keep civilisation running.. they will have to keep everyone they can't feed out or face collapse too. It's not going to be pretty if it comes to that.
But then again... North Korea continues to function, in its own way, after having basically experienced agricultural and economic collapse already.

"ew0xiyn",6,"Ultimately, no one knows.

We have good evidence that societies in general are vulnerable to the kinds of major economic, physical and social shocks that would be the direct consequences of such levels of warming (breakdowns in law and order, major failings in communications, electricity, transport and financial infrastructure, etc.). It is this vulnerability that lead many to reason that if you knocked out enough of these foundations 'civilization' would collapse, as governments and institutions of education, health and culture would fall by the wayside as we prioritized more immediate survival. Alternatively, the shocks would cause us to lay blame on our neighbours and global warfare would be the major driving force of our downfall.

But on the other hand, no-one knows how our current societies could adapt to these challenges, because we've never faced them before in the same way, and human society is fundamentally different to the last time we faced major physical catastrophe (like the last Ice Age) - and arguably even significantly different to the last time we grappled with man-made catastrophes (like the World Wars).

Predicting peoples' reactions to things at this level remains beyond the realm of science, so by definition most of the media coverage ends up being speculation. But it's a pretty safe to say that even the most optimistic assessment of the impacts of 5-6°C warming  involve some extremely major challenges to society, resulting in some pretty extreme changes to how people organized themselves.","climate_science",2019-08-05 12:51:00,"cm7uui","gustibustutandum",0,6,0,TRUE,2017-06-06 23:15:03,8,22,250,1359,1639,21,"I’ve heard from major news sources like Nat Geo and Sky News that those two degree increases would literally lead to civilizational collapse and virtual human extinction.

A lot of the science doesn't state directly that 'humans will go extinct' or 'civilization will collapse' (if *any* that are reliable), and a lot of the research/papers that occur don't test for these ranges, and much of the impact studies relate to two degrees in particular: 1.5C and 4C.

You won't really find any scientists worth their salt saying these will happen either, as there are a great many factors that go into these, though I would imagine most would agree these scenarios are more likely the higher in temp. increase we go. However, these would be -beyond- anything humans have ever experienced, and at least *one* scenario would be plausible.

**Plain Language Summary**

The Pliocene Epoch is the most recent time in Earth history when CO2 levels exceeded 400 ppm. The climate was warmer than preindustrial times, with smaller ice sheets. Previous studies suggested that the Pacific ocean was stuck in a “permanent El Niño"" during the Pliocene. However, climate model simulations do not predict that this would happen at CO2 levels near 400 ppm ‐ unusual changes in climate, such as large changes in cloud cover or hurricane frequency, would be needed to explain it. In this work we reanalyze Pliocene SST data and do not find evidence of a “permanent El Niño.” Our results suggest that difference in temperatures across the tropical Pacific was smaller than it is today, but only by about 1°C. Climate model simulations agree with our new analysis, suggesting that higher CO2, along with small changes in ice, vegetation, and mountains, are enough to explain Pliocene climate. We also show that the SST patterns in the Pliocene Pacific Ocean look similar to those that climate models predict under a low‐emissions climate change scenario. The similarity suggests that the Pliocene can help us understand how the tropics respond to an ongoing increase in CO2.

**Abstract**

With CO2 concentrations similar to today (410 ppm), the Pliocene Epoch offers insights into climate changes under a moderately warmer world. Previous work suggested a low zonal sea‐surface temperature (SST) gradient in the tropical Pacific during the Pliocene, the so‐called “permanent El Niño."" Here, we re‐calculate SSTs using the alkenone proxy and find moderate reductions in the both zonal and meridional SST gradients during the mid‐Piacenzian warm period (MPWP). These reductions are captured by coupled climate model simulations of the Pliocene, especially those that simulate weaker Walker circulation. We also produce a spatial reconstruction of MPWP Pacific SSTs that closely resembles both Pliocene and future, low‐emissions simulations; a pattern that is to a first order, diagnostic of weaker Walker circulation. Therefore, Pliocene warmth does not require drastic changes in the climate system ‐ rather, it supports the expectation that the Walker circulation will weaken in the future under higher CO2","GlobalClimateChange",2019-08-02 01:11:27,"ckx8uo","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"Ancient Plankton Help Researchers Predict Near-Future Climate: The new research shows the pattern of warming during the Pliocene looks a lot like future model projections under moderate CO2 levels, and supports a weakening of Walker circulation under high CO2.",0.72,3,0,2019-08-02 01:10:41,2019-08-02

This study presents a simulated simultaneous retrieval of mass mean cloud ice particle effective diameter, ice water content, water vapor, and temperature profiles using a combination of a 94‐GHz cloud radar and multifrequency (118, 183, 240, 310, 380, 664, and 850 GHz) millimeter‐ and submillimeter‐wave radiometers from a space platform.

We show that this combined active and passive remote sensing approach with SmallSat technologies addresses a gap in the current state‐of‐the‐art remote sensing measurements of ice cloud properties, especially deriving vertical profiles of ice cloud particle sizes in the atmosphere together with the ambient thermodynamic conditions. Therefore, this new approach can serve as a plausible candidate for future missions that target cloud and precipitation processes to improve weather forecasts and climate predictions.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-31 04:54:32,"ck3o1s","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"A Better Way to Measure Cloud Composition - An enhanced satellite remote sensing suite accurately measures ice particles, temperature, and water vapor.",1,2,0,2019-07-31 04:53:18,2019-07-31

Future energy demand is likely to increase due to climate change, but the magnitude depends on many interacting sources of uncertainty. We combine econometrically estimated responses of energy use to income, hot and cold days with future projections of spatial population and national income under five socioeconomic scenarios and temperature increases around 2050 for two emission scenarios simulated by 21 Earth System Models (ESMs). Here we show that, across 210 realizations of socioeconomic and climate scenarios, vigorous (moderate) warming increases global climate-exposed energy demand before adaptation around 2050 by 25–58% (11–27%), on top of a factor 1.7–2.8 increase above present-day due to socioeconomic developments. We find broad agreement among ESMs that energy demand rises by more than 25% in the tropics and southern regions of the USA, Europe and China.

ERFaci can be considered as the residual between ERFand ERFari ∼ −2.19 W m−2, which is close to the anthropogenicaerosol indirect effects (AIE) in Wang et al.(2014) and the simulated AIE by CAM5 (Ghan et al.,2012), but **much larger than the values given by IPCC**(2013) \[−0.45 (−1.2, 0) W m−2\]. Hoose et al. (2009)found that the AIE was very sensitive to the lower boundof cloud droplet number concentration (CDNCmin), andthe absolute value of AIE decreased rapidly when theCDNCmin increased from 0 to 40 cm−3. Many modelshave adopted different CDNCmin, but **CDNCmin was setat 0 in this study**, as the prescription of CDNCmin is stillphysically unclear (Hoose et al., 2009). **This is the mainreason for the much larger simulated ERFaci**.

Abstract:  Limiting global warming to 1.5 or 2.0°C requires strong mitigation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Concurrently, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols will decline, due to coemission with GHG, and measures to improve air quality. However, the combined climate effect of GHG and aerosol emissions over the industrial era is poorly constrained. Here we show the climate impacts from removing present‐day anthropogenic aerosol emissions and compare them to the impacts from moderate GHG‐dominated global warming. Removing aerosols induces a global mean surface heating of 0.5–1.1°C, and precipitation increase of 2.0–4.6%. Extreme weather indices also increase. We find a higher sensitivity of extreme events to aerosol reductions, per degree of surface warming, in particular over the major aerosol emission regions. Under near‐term warming, we find that regional climate change will depend strongly on the balance between aerosol and GHG forcing.","climate_science",2019-07-30 03:22:01,"cisdm6","[deleted]",0,2,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,4,NA,"I'd like comments on this paper: The updated effective radiative forcing of major anthropogenic aerosols and their effects on global climate at present and in the future, Zhang, et al. 2016",0.84,4,0,2019-07-28 06:02:07,2019-07-28

The average American home uses 867 kWh / month. 

If that electricity is produced from burning coal, the CO2 released will, over it's long lifetime, eventually result in a cumulative radiative forcing of about 867 kWh * 86 tons TNT / kWh = 74 kilotons of TNT, or 5 times the energy of the Hiroshima bombing.

"evcu47v",6,"There are several issues with this study. First, they assume constant cloudiness. Another paper found that there is much more cloud over the melted ice. The source they use to base their constant cloudiness on only showed that there is constant cloudiness at the height of summer but the minimum sea ice extent is in september.

Two studies also published in 2019 find that there is an increase in cloudiness over the melted ice. The [clouds contributed 2-3 times the albedo effect of the ice / se](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/10/1/12/htm)a. When the ice melts then the [clouds cover an average of 81%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44155-w) over the period where the albedo effect operates.

As an [academic response](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/21/E2157) to their [2014 earlier pape](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/9/3322.abstract)r said, averaged over the whole world the changing climate from 2000 to 2012 has lead to a reduction in the global flux by 0.14 watts per square meter rather than an increase. Most of that reduction is in the southern hemisphere (reduction of 0.26 watts per square meter compared to a 0.03 watts per square meter in the northern hemisphere).

This is the map shared in that letter. It shows the change in total  solar energy input from 2000 to 2012 where red means it got hotter,  blue cooler, yellow is a slight reduction. As you'll see the Arctic is red or orange showing a clear increase but many other areas of the world are green or blue showing a strong decrease in watts per square meter.

 So their estimates for the Arctic for the future are over estimates and their assumption that the Arctic albedo change will warm the entire world is based on blinkered thinking not looking at the rest of the world. 

 The IPCC report in 2018 found that there are no tipping points from Actic ice melt (see[ 3.6.3.1 Sea Ice](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/)). As soon as we reach zero emissions the Arctic ice then is in steady state and will slowly being to heal as some of the excess CO2 leaves the atmosphere.

We will get another overview in 2021, [IPCC Working Group II starts preparing their contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/2019/01/15/ipcc-wgiiar6-lam1/) but I think it is safe to say they will not be making any changes in their projections as a result of this paper.

**Abstract**

During the first half of the nineteenth century, several large tropical volcanic eruptions occurred within less than three decades. The global climate effects of the 1815 Tambora eruption have been investigated, but those of an eruption in 1808 or 1809 whose source is unknown and the eruptions in the 1820s and 1830s have received less attention. Here we analyse the effect of the sequence of eruptions in observations, global three-dimensional climate field reconstructions and coupled climate model simulations. All the eruptions were followed by substantial drops of summer temperature over the Northern Hemisphere land areas. In addition to the direct radiative effect, which lasts 2–3 years, the simulated ocean–atmosphere heat exchange sustained cooling for several years after these eruptions, which affected the slow components of the climate system. Africa was hit by two decades of drought, global monsoons weakened and the tracks of low-pressure systems over the North Atlantic moved south. The low temperatures and increased precipitation in Europe triggered the last phase of the advance of Alpine glaciers. Only after the 1850s did the transition into the period of anthropogenic warming start. We conclude that the end of the Little Ice Age was marked by the recovery from a sequence of volcanic eruptions, which makes it difficult to define a single pre-industrial baseline.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-29 17:54:57,"cjerri","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,7,NA,"5 large eruptions occurred in the early 19th century, causing cooling, drying in the monsoon regions and growth of glaciers in the Alps.

&gt;With partial-year sea ice loss, this is likely to not be a massive jump up to this, and its highly unlikely this would be a jump at all (all sea ice would have to vanish all at once for this!), but more a gradual shift into this as the sea ice diminishes, especially as it approaches being year-round ice free.

### ABSTRACT

The effective radiative forcing (ERF), as newly defined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5), of three anthropogenic aerosols \[sulphate (SF), black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC)\] and their comprehensive climatic effects were simulated and discussed, using the updated aerosol‐climate online model of BCC\_AGCM2.0.1\_CUACE/Aero. From 1850 to 2010, the total ERF of these anthropogenic aerosols was −2.49 W m−2, of which the aerosol–radiation interactive ERF (ERFari) and aerosol–cloud interactive ERF (ERFaci) were ∼ −0.30 and −2.19 W m−2, respectively. SF was the largest contributor to the total ERF, with an ERF of −2.37 W m−2. The ERF of BC and OC were 0.12 and −0.31 W m−2, respectively. From 1850 to 2010, anthropogenic aerosols brought about a decrease of ∼2.53 K and ∼0.20 mm day−1 in global annual mean surface temperature and precipitation, respectively. Surface cooling was most obvious over mid‐ and high latitudes in the northern hemisphere (NH). Precipitation change was most pronounced near the equator, with decreased and increased rainfall to the north and south of the equator, respectively; this might be largely related to the enhanced Hadley Cell in the NH. Relative humidity near surface was increased, especially over land, due to surface cooling induced by anthropogenic aerosols. Cloud cover and water path were increased, especially in or near the source regions of anthropogenic aerosols. Experiments based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 given in IPCC AR5 shows the dramatic decrease in three anthropogenic aerosols in 2100 will lead to an increase of ∼2.06 K and 0.16 mm day−1 in global annual mean surface temperature and precipitation, respectively, compared with those in 2010.","climate_science",2019-07-28 06:02:14,"cisdm6","[deleted]",0,3,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,4,NA,"I'd like comments on this paper: The updated effective radiative forcing of major anthropogenic aerosols and their effects on global climate at present and in the future, Zhang, et al. 2016",0.84,4,0,2019-07-28 06:02:07,2019-07-28

**Abstract**

The online video-sharing website YouTube is extremely popular globally, also as a tool for information on science and environmental topics. However, only little is known about what kind of information users find when they are searching for information about climate science, climate change, and climate engineering on YouTube. This contribution presents results from an exploratory research project that investigates whether videos found on YouTube adhere to or challenge scientific consensus views. Ten search terms were employed to search for and analyze 200 videos about climate and climate modification topics, which are contested topics in online media. The online anonymization tool Tor has been used for the randomization of the sample and to avoid personalization of the results. A heuristic qualitative classification tool was set up to categorize the videos in the sample. Eighty-nine videos of the 200 videos in the sample are supporting scientific consensus views about anthropogenic climate change, and climate scientists are discussing climate topics with deniers of climate change in four videos in the sample. Unexpectedly, the majority of the videos in the sample (107 videos) supports worldviews that are opposing scientific consensus views: 16 videos deny anthropogenic climate change and 91 videos in the sample propagate straightforward conspiracy theories about climate engineering and climate change. Videos supporting the scientific mainstream view received only slightly more views (16,941,949 views in total) than those opposing the mainstream scientific position (16,939,655 views in total). Consequences for the public communication of climate change and climate engineering are discussed in the second part of the article. The research presented in this contribution is particularly interested in finding out more about strategically distorted communications about climate change and climate engineering in online environments and in critically analyzing them.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-26 21:48:31,"ci905i","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,33,NA,"Most YouTube climate change videos 'oppose the consensus view'.

**Underwater melting**

How fast does warm ocean water melt glaciers that terminate in the sea? That question is central to understanding how fast ice sheets may lose mass, and thus how fast sea level will rise, in response to global warming, but there are few data about the process. Sutherland et al. used repeat multibeam sonar surveys to observe an Alaskan subsurface tidewater glacier face to create a time series of its melting and calving patterns. They observed melt rates up to a hundred times larger than those predicted by theory, observations that compel us to reevaluate predictions of such ice loss.

**Abstract**

Ice loss from the world’s glaciers and ice sheets contributes to sea level rise, influences ocean circulation, and affects ecosystem productivity. Ongoing changes in glaciers and ice sheets are driven by submarine melting and iceberg calving from tidewater glacier margins. However, predictions of glacier change largely rest on unconstrained theory for submarine melting. Here, we use repeat multibeam sonar surveys to image a subsurface tidewater glacier face and document a time-variable, three-dimensional geometry linked to melting and calving patterns. Submarine melt rates are high across the entire ice face over both seasons surveyed and increase from spring to summer. The observed melt rates are up to two orders of magnitude greater than predicted by theory, challenging current simulations of ice loss from tidewater glaciers.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-26 21:26:49,"ci8qwk","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"Direct observations of submarine melt and subsurface geometry at a tidewater glacier show melt rates are up to two orders of magnitude greater than predicted by theory, challenging current simulations of ice loss from tidewater glaciers.",1,3,0,2019-07-26 21:25:39,2019-07-26

Is the current GHG concentration ""ahead"" or ""behind"" schedule compared to say RCP8.5, and by how much?

The reason I ask is that I'm a climate scientist specializing in local impacts for adaptation and risk assessment, and the folks who use our projections are increasingly asking about where RCP8.5 fits in terms of emissions reduction strategies and where we are at so far. I've generally viewed this question as a red herring but it's just coming up too much to not answer any more.

If you look at the values in Table 2 of [https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html) for Total Radiative Forcing they are larger than the historical numbers at [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare) by about 50% in 1980.

Of course these aren't directly comparable as the NOAA paper is just converting concentrations with constants and ignoring feedbacks. So I suspect the main difference is water vapour feedback perhaps? The RCP database notes that total concentration exludes mineral dust and the effect of land albedo, however.

The difference between the two measures of total radiative forcing decreases with time and if you extrapolate from the 4 points of overlap it would be about 32% today. Applying this ratio seems to suggest that we are doing (a little bit) better in 2018 than RCP8.5 forcing by 2020 was projected to be. Does this sound about right? I had it in my head that we'd been emitting worse than RCP8.5 for quite some time now but maybe that was a few years ago and we've actually started turning away from this pathway a bit?

**Abstract**

Multidecadal surface temperature changes may be forced by natural as well as anthropogenic factors, or arise unforced from the climate system. Distinguishing these factors is essential for estimating sensitivity to multiple climatic forcings and the amplitude of the unforced variability. Here we present 2,000-year-long global mean temperature reconstructions using seven different statistical methods that draw from a global collection of temperature-sensitive palaeoclimate records. Our reconstructions display synchronous multidecadal temperature fluctuations that are coherent with one another and with fully forced millennial model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 across the Common Era. A substantial portion of pre-industrial (1300–1800 ce) variability at multidecadal timescales is attributed to volcanic aerosol forcing. Reconstructions and simulations qualitatively agree on the amplitude of the unforced global mean multidecadal temperature variability, thereby increasing confidence in future projections of climate change on these timescales. The largest warming trends at timescales of 20 years and longer occur during the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-24 20:29:01,"chdicg","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,14,NA,"In contrast to pre-industrial climate fluctuations, current, anthropogenic climate change is occurring across the whole world at the same time.

**Abstract**

Earth’s climate history is often understood by breaking it down into constituent climatic epochs1. Over the Common Era (the past 2,000 years) these epochs, such as the Little Ice Age, have been characterized as having occurred at the same time across extensive spatial scales5. Although the rapid global warming seen in observations over the past 150 years does show nearly global coherence6, the spatiotemporal coherence of climate epochs earlier in the Common Era has yet to be robustly tested. Here we use global palaeoclimate reconstructions for the past 2,000 years, and find no evidence for preindustrial globally coherent cold and warm epochs. In particular, we find that the coldest epoch of the last millennium—the putative Little Ice Age—is most likely to have experienced the coldest temperatures during the fifteenth century in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, during the seventeenth century in northwestern Europe and southeastern North America, and during the mid-nineteenth century over most of the remaining regions. Furthermore, the spatial coherence that does exist over the preindustrial Common Era is consistent with the spatial coherence of stochastic climatic variability. This lack of spatiotemporal coherence indicates that preindustrial forcing was not sufficient to produce globally synchronous extreme temperatures at multidecadal and centennial timescales. By contrast, we find that the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the twentieth century for more than 98 per cent of the globe. This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures, but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the past 2,000 years.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-24 20:28:38,"chdicg","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,14,NA,"In contrast to pre-industrial climate fluctuations, current, anthropogenic climate change is occurring across the whole world at the same time.

The reason I bring this up is because just because Methane is a potent gas on Earth today doesn’t mean it always will be (it will become weaker relative to CO2 over time as it’s concentration increases), that it always has been (Earth’s atmosphere looked very different billions of years ago), or that it is just as potent on other planetary bodies (e.g. Titan, which has *a lot* of methane in its atmosphere).","climate_science",2019-07-24 11:42:41,"cgwgbk","[deleted]",0,6,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,8,NA,"I was curious about Methane in the atmosphere, and how I was told it's often overlooked, but garners more powerful effects than Carbon when released in the atmosphere?",0.91,8,0,2019-07-23 18:30:11,2019-07-23

The problem is not in communicating the science. The scientific evidence has been clear for decades. People don't avoid taking action on climate because they don't have the facts. They don't take action because it conflicts with their world view, and/or their ability to make a profit (or for their mates to make a profit).

XR doesn't have a problem with communicating the science, it does fine. Climate activists rarely communicate the science perfectly, but they generally get it close enough. Mistakes are usually minor, but *anything* slightly wrong will be picked up by the capitalist media, because they aren't interested in the truth, they're just interested in discrediting the climate action narrative.

I don't really know what can be done about it, other than keeping on keeping on. The climate movement has a massive task ahead of it, and the neo-liberal media-industry complex has massive inertia, but it will happen eventually, the only question is how much we're going to fuck things up before we overhaul our global system. Nicholas Klein's quote is worth remembering: ""First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.""

**Abstract**

Ship tracks appear as long winding linear features in satellite images and are produced by aerosols from ship exhausts changing low cloud properties. They are one of the best examples of aerosol‐cloud interaction experiments. However, manually finding ship tracks from satellite data on a large scale is prohibitively costly while a large number of samples are required to improve our understanding. Here we train a deep neural network to automate finding ship tracks. The neural network model generalizes well as it not only finds ship tracks labeled by human experts but also detects those that are occasionally missed by humans. It finds more ship tracks than all previous studies combined and produces a map of ship track distributions off the California coast that matches well with known shipping traffic. Our technique will enable studying aerosol effects on low clouds using ship tracks on a large scale, which will potentially narrow the uncertainty of the aerosol‐cloud interactions.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-24 04:49:37,"ch3kzy","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,6,NA,"Algorithm Spots Climate-Altering Ship Tracks in Satellite Data - Tens of thousands of ship tracks—cloud structures created when ships’ exhaust plumes interact with the atmosphere—are pinpointed automatically, furthering study of these climate-altering features.",0.88,6,0,2019-07-24 04:48:21,2019-07-24

"eunbvrx",6,"Methane is somewhere between 150x-120x more potent than CO2 when initially released, however I recently found this quick excerpt from scientist Gavin Schmidt from the blog Realclimate:  GWP on very short periods is not a useful thing to calculate because the climate system integrates GHG forcings over decades. Even 20 years is a bit of stretch. 50 or 100 year periods are the most relevant for what will actually happen. – gavin 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a layman, so this may be wrong but: While methane does contribute quite a bit to radiative forcing, it often degrades before the full effect of that can be felt on the climate system. In other words, the system isn't in equilibrium while methane enters the system.  [https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/causes-of-climate-change/0/steps/13583](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/causes-of-climate-change/0/steps/13583) 

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, even if there were some abrupt ""pulse"" of methane or whichever, it most likely would never even be fully integrated into the climate due to degradation and lag. However, methane degrades into CO2 so it does add to the long-tail of risks. 

&amp;#x200B;

In comparison to CO2, methane has a pretty short lifetime. The lifetime of methane is around 12.4 years, while CO2 lasts 20-200 years. However, to remove the last of that carbon dioxide it can take several hundred thousand years.

"euluu1l",6,"Thanks for the post! I'm glad to see this attitude from the XR, as they have a tendency to make a lot of claims based off of Beckwith &amp; Wadhams, plus Deep Adaptation. There's a lot of misinformation going on, especially now that [Hallam himself is saying things about mass death in the short term.](https://i.imgur.com/fawHP6t.jpg) (also thank you for using my favorite Kate Marvel quote)

A good starting point would be [in this list here.](https://twitter.com/KHayhoe/lists/scientists-who-do-climate?s=09), as they cover a lot of specialties and definitely address the XR, but also answer questions.

Another would be the models themselves- research CIMP5/CIMP6 as they're important for climate sensitivity, though you already know this given you post them a lot.

I had Peter Kalmus [suggest this source](https://nca2014.globalchange.gov) as well to me recently.

As mentioned in a DM I sent you on /u/ClimateNurse (account isn't old enough to post here, alas!), [David A. McKay covers extraordinary claims here, some of which are from the XR](www.climatetippingpoints.info)

Avoid Wadhams and Beckwith, McPhereson as well. Make sure you emphasize on how global dimming works (I made a giant post about this on /u/ClimateNurse, it's rudimentary though, so it's not 100% accurate but it's a good place to get an idea of how it works.) I also covered the methane bomb/hydrates there.

Katharine Hayhoe has a massive YouTube channel backed by PBS called Global Weirding', and she tackles a lot of claims and ideas involving climate change.

www.skepticalscience.com is great, as is www.climatefeedback.org, as they address David Wallace-Wells 'The Uninhabitable Earth' and the recent think-tank report from Australia predicting the fall of civilization from 2050+. 

Carbon Brief has AMAZING work. Check them out and their data list on the damages from 1.5 to 2c, as it sometimes goes out to 4C.

...And claims by Peter Wadhams from as early as 2016.

Glen Peters also covers a lot on his Twitter. Avoid Ben See if you go on there though, he's overwhelmingly alarmist and uses Beckwith/Wadhams excessively, uses out of date media, an d predicts 4C by 2050.

Other claims:

**Abstract**

Climate-related risks are dependent not only on the warming trend from GHGs, but also on the variability about the trend. However, assessment of the impacts of climate change tends to focus on the ultimate level of global warming, only occasionally on the rate of global warming, and rarely on variability about the trend. Here we show that models that are more sensitive to GHGs emissions (that is, higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)) also have higher temperature variability on timescales of several years to several decades. Counter-intuitively, high-sensitivity climates, as well as having a higher chance of rapid decadal warming, are also more likely to have had historical ‘hiatus’ periods than lower-sensitivity climates. Cooling or hiatus decades over the historical period, which have been relatively uncommon, are more than twice as likely in a high-ECS world (ECS = 4.5 K) compared with a low-ECS world (ECS = 1.5 K). As ECS also affects the background warming rate under future scenarios with unmitigated anthropogenic forcing, the probability of a hyper-warming decade—over ten times the mean rate of global warming for the twentieth century—is even more sensitive to ECS.

**Abstract**

The feasibility of large-scale biological CO2 removal to achieve stringent climate targets remains unclear. Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) offers an alternative negative emissions technology (NET) option. Here we conduct the first inter-model comparison on the role of DACCS in 1.5 and 2 °C scenarios, under a variety of techno-economic assumptions. Deploying DACCS significantly reduces mitigation costs, and it complements rather than substitutes other NETs. The key factor limiting DACCS deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios’ average DACCS scale-up rates of 1.5 GtCO2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300 EJ/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that DACCS can be deployed at scale, and finding it to be subsequently unavailable, leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8 °C. DACCS should therefore be developed and deployed alongside, rather than instead of, other mitigation options.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-23 05:57:18,"cgoop4","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"Direct CO2 capture machines could use ‘a quarter of global energy’ in 2100",0.83,11,0,2019-07-23 05:55:38,2019-07-23
"euilhuk",4,"Ok so I've actually been fiddling around quite a bit with the NOAA and RPC database this last month so I think I can give a partial answer.

The NOAA does not take into account the (overall negative) forcing due to aerosols. They state they do this because of the remaining big uncertainty on those forcings.

That being said if you look at the RPC database's CO2e concentrations for ""GHGs only"", you will notice that they are also lower than the NOAA's. This is because the denomination ""GHGs only"" in the RPC database does not include all GHGs, but only those in the Kyoto perimeter, whereas the NOAA includes most common GHGs.

Moreover as you say the NOAA does not take into account feedback loops, but I don't know to which extend the RPC database does (that's up to each RPC).

As for your last question, I can give a partial answer by those two graphs https://imgur.com/1D3JAQI https://imgur.com/sWM1F5q. Those show the CO2e and AGGI from the RPC by taking into account only the GHG (but not only the Kyoto perimeter ones, i.e. I do as NOAA does) compared to 2018 values. In a way what I did was put the RPC Database and NOAA data on the same baseline / methods.

According to those graphs, the GHG emissions interpreted as immediate forcings^1 show two things. First, we are slightly below RPC8.5 but very close. Second, we're still near the beginning of the RPC's predictions so all four RPCs are quite close, therefore it would be hasty to say that ""we are clearly on RPC8.5 track"" from this alone.

---

1. Another method would be to use the GHP100 (integrated radiative forcing over 100 years) but the result would not be very different, since we have slightly more N2O (long-lived) than we expected from RPC8.5","climate_science",2019-07-23 02:52:28,"cgm8ub","hippalectryon0",0,4,0,TRUE,2014-04-10 23:02:30,0,0,242,957,1199,11,"Does anyone know how to make an apples to apples comparison of ""how far along"" we are in terms of the RCPs? Is the current GHG concentration ""ahead"" or ""behind"" schedule compared to say RCP8.5, and by how much?

The reason I ask is that I'm a climate scientist specializing in local impacts for adaptation and risk assessment, and the folks who use our projections are increasingly asking about where RCP8.5 fits in terms of emissions reduction strategies and where we are at so far. I've generally viewed this question as a red herring but it's just coming up too much to not answer any more.

If you look at the values in Table 2 of [https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html) for Total Radiative Forcing they are larger than the historical numbers at [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=compare) by about 50% in 1980.

Of course these aren't directly comparable as the NOAA paper is just converting concentrations with constants and ignoring feedbacks. So I suspect the main difference is water vapour feedback perhaps? The RCP database notes that total concentration exludes mineral dust and the effect of land albedo, however.

The difference between the two measures of total radiative forcing decreases with time and if you extrapolate from the 4 points of overlap it would be about 32% today. Applying this ratio seems to suggest that we are doing (a little bit) better in 2018 than RCP8.5 forcing by 2020 was projected to be. Does this sound about right? I had it in my head that we'd been emitting worse than RCP8.5 for quite some time now but maybe that was a few years ago and we've actually started turning away from this pathway a bit?

One month of wildfires isn't the end of the world. If fires of comparable size become a trend month after month, that would be very worrying.

"eu7aofp",12,"I noticed someone asked David McKay about the article you linked about soil carbon.

&amp;gt;I hadn’t seen this paper yet (been on holidays). – it’s nicely done and the point of accounting for processes like compaction is sound.

&amp;gt;What’s interesting is how most of lost carbon ends up laterally transported by water rather than emitted directly as CO2 to the atmosphere. The implication is that previous experiments observing permafrost CO2 emissions got that about right, but missed even more carbon being seeped away by water under the surface, either in dissolved or particle form. How this then affects total CO2 emissions gets complicated though – it depends on what happens to that dissolved /particulate carbon once it gets flushed out into rivers and the sea, where it can be buried and lost or respired and slightly enrich the seawater carbon stock (which might in turn affect CO2 drawdown in the ocean). As they put it, “the fate of the transported C is highly uncertain”. The caveat to all this though, as ever with experimental/observational studies, is how much this can be extrapolated across all the permafrost region, as soil types and dynamics can widely vary and this process may happen in some soil types more than others.

&amp;gt;Overall I think the main takeaway is that more permafrost C might well be lost than I summarise in this article, but that this extra C probably won’t be directly emitted as CO2 (it may end up emitted some point later depending on seawater chemistry, or buried at sea – it’s hard to say). This paper also backs up the point about how very little of permafrost C ends up as methane during degradation, with them finding it almost negligible in this experiment.

Having read the paper myself too, it neglects (unlike other websites) on how their study discovered how the soil carbon is absorbed into pools and other sorts of water and dissolved into it. We knew soil carbon was released before into the atmosphere, but not into water through this method (which may release later on).

&amp;gt;""This study was novel because we used new methods to directly track the soil carbon losses, and they were much higher than we previously thought,"" Schuur said. ""This suggests that not only is carbon being lost through greenhouse gases directly to the atmosphere but also dissolved in waters that flow through the soil and likely carried carbon into streams, leaves and rivers.""

The researchers say there's a good chance they're looking at an area going through a phase of rapid change that may not be true everywhere or at all times.

____

**Summary**

**Background**

Increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) affect global nutrition via effects on agricultural productivity and nutrient content of food crops. We combined these effects with economic projections to estimate net changes in nutrient availability between 2010 and 2050.

**Methods**

In this modelling study, we used the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade to project per capita availability of protein, iron, and zinc in 2050. We used estimated changes in productivity of individual agricultural commodities to model effects on production, trade, prices, and consumption under moderate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Two independent sources of data, which used different methodologies to determine the effect of increased atmospheric CO2 on different key crops, were combined with the modelled food supply results to estimate future nutrient availability.

**Findings**

Although technological change, market responses, and the effects of CO2 fertilisation on yield are projected to increase global availability of dietary protein, iron, and zinc, these increases are moderated by negative effects of climate change affecting productivity and carbon penalties on nutrient content. The carbon nutrient penalty results in decreases in the global availability of dietary protein of 4·1%, iron of 2·8%, and zinc of 2·5% as calculated using one dataset, and decreases in global availability of dietary protein of 2·9%, iron of 3·9%, and zinc of 3·4% using the other dataset. The combined effects of projected increases in atmospheric CO2 (ie, carbon nutrient penalty, CO2 fertilisation, and climate effects on productivity) will decrease growth in the global availability of nutrients by 19·5% for protein, 14·4% for iron, and 14·6% for zinc relative to expected technology and market gains by 2050. The many countries that currently have high levels of nutrient deficiency would continue to be disproportionately affected.

**Interpretation**

This approach is an improvement in estimating future global food security by simultaneously projecting climate change effects on crop productivity and changes in nutrient content under increased concentrations of CO2, which accounts for a much larger effect on nutrient availability than CO2 fertilisation. Regardless of the scenario used to project future consumption patterns, the net effect of increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will slow progress in decreasing global nutrient deficiencies.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-19 06:23:59,"cf3x4e","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,7,NA,"Rising CO2, climate change projected to reduce availability of nutrients worldwide",0.82,7,0,2019-07-19 06:11:49,2019-07-19

**Abstract**

Research reported during the past decade has shown that global warming is roughly proportional to the total amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This makes it possible to estimate the remaining carbon budget: the total amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide that can still be emitted into the atmosphere while holding the global average temperature increase to the limit set by the Paris Agreement. However, a wide range of estimates for the remaining carbon budget has been reported, reducing the effectiveness of the remaining carbon budget as a means of setting emission reduction targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement. Here we present a framework that enables us to track estimates of the remaining carbon budget and to understand how these estimates can improve over time as scientific knowledge advances. We propose that application of this framework may help to reconcile differences between estimates of the remaining carbon budget and may provide a basis for reducing uncertainty in the range of future estimates.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-19 06:10:39,"cf3why","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"What Counts for Our Climate: Carbon Budgets Untangled",1,2,0,2019-07-19 06:09:50,2019-07-19

**Abstract**

Existing estimates of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) indicate that, during the early twentieth century, the North Atlantic and northeast Pacific oceans warmed by twice the global average, whereas the northwest Pacific Ocean cooled by an amount equal to the global average. Such a heterogeneous pattern suggests first-order contributions from regional variations in forcing or in ocean–atmosphere heat fluxes. These older SST estimates are, however, derived from measurements of water temperatures in ship-board buckets, and must be corrected for substantial biases. Here we show that correcting for offsets among groups of bucket measurements leads to SST variations that correlate better with nearby land temperatures and are more homogeneous in their pattern of warming. Offsets are identified by systematically comparing nearby SST observations among different groups. Correcting for offsets in German measurements decreases warming rates in the North Atlantic, whereas correcting for Japanese measurement offsets leads to increased and more uniform warming in the North Pacific. Japanese measurement offsets in the 1930s primarily result from records having been truncated to whole degrees Celsius when the records were digitized in the 1960s. These findings underscore the fact that historical SST records reflect both physical and social dimensions in data collection, and suggest that further opportunities exist for improving the accuracy of historical SST records.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-18 05:07:38,"ceo47d","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,6,NA,"Correcting historic sea surface temperature measurements leads to more homogeneous early-twentieth-century sea surface warming",0.88,6,0,2019-07-18 05:07:09,2019-07-18

"etvkxo5",1,"That doesn't mean you get to completely disregard sources in these discussions. If you read through my comment history you'd see that I (probably) agree with you. Doesn't mean that you get to avoid providing sources or statements to support your opinion, however. This subreddit is focused on the science-side of things when it comes to climate change, so sources are rightly expected when engaging.

&amp;#x200B;

Your question is much too wide for anyone to give it any real answer or thought. There's a lot of thinkers who are involved in discussions about collapse, and the general opinion comes down to: ""We don't know when it will be or how it will happen, but we can assume based on trends."" And not all of those thinkers even have the same idea or opinion about how a collapse will look or be, it is an entire subject of it's own that precedes even climatology. Frankly, it might happen. It might not happen. It's a rather divise topic.

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't want to leave  a question like this unanswered from my perspective either, so I'll say this: I personally largely believe that collapse is a moral choice we can still make as a civilisation. Am I optimistic based on current trends? Far from it. But that's why I push for action, I want to be proven wrong and thus I push to prolong this civilisation in an assistance to make it transition. I don't think anyone can say it's too late, at least not yet. I also tend to lean more towards collapse being a slower process. The system of our civilisation is extremely advanced, so I believe it may very well cannibalize itself to stay afloat longer. We'll see large swaths of people die and civil strife before a collapse occurs, sadly. People tend to forget that there are events leading to a collapse, and those are usually full of suffering in their own right. When do I think it'll happen, if it does? I don't know. Maybe 2030. Maybe 2040. Maybe any decade in the future, maybe even centuries ahead. No one knows, and until we actually ""know"", we should push for action so that it hopefully never even happens.","climate_science",2019-07-16 00:48:13,"ccsixn","[deleted]",0,1,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,44,NA,"Record breaking heat has caused more than 100 ‘unprecedented’ fires blazing through the Arctic.

"etcxl1i",2,"**Abstract:**

&gt;This paper investigates the causation for the decline of the Atlantic  Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) from approximately 17 Sv to  about 9 Sv, when the atmospheric resolution of the Max Planck  Institute‐Earth System Model is enhanced from ∼1° to ∼0.5°. The results  show that the slowdown of the AMOC is caused by the cessation of deep  convection. In most modeling studies, this is thought to be controlled  by buoyancy fluxes in the convective regions, for example, by surface  freshwater flux that is introduced locally or via enormous input from  glacier or iceberg melts. While we find that freshwater is still the key  to the reduction of AMOC seen in the higher‐resolution run, the  freshening of the North Atlantic does not need to be directly caused by  local freshwater fluxes. Instead, it can be caused indirectly through  winds via a reduced wind‐driven gyre circulation and salinity transport  associated to this circulation, as seen in the higher‐resolution run.

**Abstract**

Satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations are routinely applied toward the estimation of dynamic oblateness, C₂₀, which is the largest globally integrated component of Earth's time‐variable gravity field. Since 2002, GRACE and GRACE Follow‐On have revolutionized the recovery of higher spatial resolution features of global time‐variable gravity, with SLR continuing to provide the most reliable estimates of C₂₀. We quantify the effect of various SLR processing strategies on estimating C₂₀ and demonstrate better signal recovery with the inclusion of GRACE‐derived low‐degree gravity information in the forward model. This improved SLR product modifies the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheet mass trends by −15.4 and −3.5 Gt/year, respectively, as compared to CSR TN11, and improves global mean sea level budget closure by modifying sea level rise by +0.08 mm/year. We recommend that this new C₂₀ product be applied to RL06 GRACE data products for enhanced accuracy and scientific interpretation.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-07 03:01:03,"ca25ve","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"Tracking Earth’s Shape Reveals Greater Polar Ice Loss - Researchers offer a solution to better track mass changes in ocean water and polar ice.",0.84,11,0,2019-07-07 02:58:17,2019-07-07

**The potential for global forest cover**

The restoration of forested land at a global scale could help capture atmospheric carbon and mitigate climate change. Bastin et al. used direct measurements of forest cover to generate a model of forest restoration potential across the globe (see the Perspective by Chazdon and Brancalion). Their spatially explicit maps show how much additional tree cover could exist outside of existing forests and agricultural and urban land. Ecosystems could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest. This would represent a greater than 25% increase in forested area, including more than 500 billion trees and more than 200 gigatonnes of additional carbon at maturity. Such a change has the potential to cut the atmospheric carbon pool by about 25%.

**Abstract**

The restoration of trees remains among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation. We mapped the global potential tree coverage to show that 4.4 billion hectares of canopy cover could exist under the current climate. Excluding existing trees and agricultural and urban areas, we found that there is room for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of canopy cover, which could store 205 gigatonnes of carbon in areas that would naturally support woodlands and forests. This highlights global tree restoration as our most effective climate change solution to date. However, climate change will alter this potential tree coverage. We estimate that if we cannot deviate from the current trajectory, the global potential canopy cover may shrink by ~223 million hectares by 2050, with the vast majority of losses occurring in the tropics. Our results highlight the opportunity of climate change mitigation through global tree restoration but also the urgent need for action.

Sure, it may be ""too late"" to prevent some level of damage, but then there's some people claiming that 3 C or more of warming is already locked in with just our current emissions alone due to feedbacks, and there's little in the way of hard science to support that.

I'm fine with people discussing unlikely but catastrophic events as long as the appropriate caveats are noted. They serve as examples of how bad things could possibly get assuming we take no action.

I don't think the comments who declares him as being conservative are entirely accurate, however. In a comment thread, he made this statement which I believe sums up his position:  ""I put it in terms of risk, with climate tipping points and feedbacks loading the dice a bit more against us by making high warming scenarios slightly more likely than otherwise (for example, in one study the upper 5% probability temperature shifts from 4.9 to 6.5°C due to tipping point risks). This means even if we stuck to an rcp 4p5 or 6p0 scenario (which represents current commitments), the chance of warming overshooting and going closer to rcp 8p5 (i.e. business-as-usual) might be somewhat higher than we originally thought.""

____

**Significance**

Carbon stored within harvested wood products (HWPs) may be a tool to mitigate climate change, yet its global potential as a carbon sink is unknown and difficult to assess. We show that the global HWP pool was a net sink of 335 Mt of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)⋅y^(−1) in 2015 and as much as 441 Mt of CO2e⋅y^(−1) by 2030, offsetting substantial amounts of industrial process emissions, but only in some countries, and the global contribution is minor, even in a scenario of favorable conditions. Furthermore, economic shocks can turn a country’s HWP pool into a net source of carbon. In conclusion, carbon stored within end-use HWPs varies widely across countries and depends on evolving market forces.

**Abstract**

Carbon stored in harvested wood products (HWPs) can affect national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories, in which the production and end use of HWPs play a key role. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides guidance on HWP carbon accounting, which is sensitive to future developments of socioeconomic factors including population, income, and trade. We estimated the carbon stored within HWPs from 1961 to 2065 for 180 countries following IPCC carbon-accounting guidelines, consistent with Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT) historical data and plausible futures outlined by the shared socioeconomic pathways. We found that the global HWP pool was a net annual sink of 335 Mt of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)⋅y^(−1) in 2015, offsetting substantial amounts of industrial processes within some countries, and as much as 441 Mt of CO2e⋅y^(−1) by 2030 under certain socioeconomic developments. Furthermore, there is a considerable sequestration gap (71 Mt of CO2e⋅y^(−1) of unaccounted carbon storage in 2015 and 120 Mt of CO2e⋅y^(−1) by 2065) under current IPCC Good Practice Guidance, as traded feedstock is ineligible for national GHG inventories. However, even under favorable socioeconomic conditions, and when accounting for the sequestration gap, carbon stored annually in HWPs is &lt;1% of global emissions. Furthermore, economic shocks can turn the HWP pool into a carbon source either long-term—e.g., the collapse of the USSR—or short-term—e.g., the US economic recession of 2008/09. In conclusion, carbon stored within end-use HWPs varies widely across countries and depends on evolving market forces.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-03 03:01:09,"c8iswg","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,5,NA,"The world’s wood products — all the paper, lumber, furniture and more — offset less than 1 percent of annual global carbon emissions by locking away carbon in woody forms, according to new research.",1,5,0,2019-07-03 02:59:09,2019-07-03

**Abstract**

Evidence suggests that 5–15% of the vast pool of soil carbon stored in northern permafrost ecosystems could be emitted as greenhouse gases by 2100 under the current path of global warming. However, direct measurements of changes in soil carbon remain scarce, largely because ground subsidence that occurs as the permafrost soils begin to thaw confounds the traditional quantification of carbon pools based on fixed depths or soil horizons. This issue is overcome when carbon is quantified in relation to a fixed ash content, which uses the relatively stable mineral component of soil as a metric for pool comparisons through time. We applied this approach to directly measure soil carbon pool changes over five years in experimentally warmed and ambient tundra ecosystems at a site in Alaska where permafrost is degrading due to climate change. We show a loss of soil carbon of 5.4% per year (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 9.5) across the site. Our results point to lateral hydrological export as a potential pathway for these surprisingly large losses. This research highlights the potential to make repeat soil carbon pool measurements at sentinel sites across the permafrost region, as this feedback to climate change may be occurring faster than previously thought.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-03 00:55:08,"c8hkr2","avogadros_number",0,3,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,16,NA,"Scientists find carbon from thawing permafrost is released into the atmosphere at higher rates than previously thought",0.88,16,0,2019-07-03 00:54:15,2019-07-03

**Abstract**

Net anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions must approach zero by mid-century (2050) to stabilize global mean temperature at the levels targeted by international efforts. Yet continued expansion of fossil-fuel energy infrastructure implies already ‘committed’ future CO2 emissions. Here we use detailed datasets of current fossil-fuel-burning energy infrastructure in 2018 to estimate regional and sectoral patterns of ‘committed’ CO2 emissions, the sensitivity of such emissions to assumed operating lifetimes and schedules, and the economic value of associated infrastructure. We estimate that, if operated as historically, existing infrastructure will emit about 658 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 (ranging from 226 to 1,479 Gt CO2 depending on assumed lifetimes and utilization rates). More than half of these emissions are projected to come from the electricity sector, and infrastructure in China, the USA and the EU28 countries represent approximately 41 per cent, 9 per cent and 7 per cent of the total, respectively. If built, proposed power plants (planned, permitted or under construction) would emit approximately an additional 188 (range 37–427) Gt CO2. Committed emissions from existing and proposed energy infrastructure (about 846 Gt CO2) thus represent more than the entire remaining carbon budget if mean warming is to be limited to 1.5 °C with a probability of 50–66 per cent (420–580 Gt CO2), and perhaps two-thirds of the remaining carbon budget if mean warming is to be limited to below 2 °C (1,170–1,500 Gt CO2). The remaining carbon budget estimates are varied and nuanced, depending on the climate target and the availability of large-scale negative emissions. Nevertheless, our emission estimates suggest that little or no additional CO2-emitting infrastructure can be commissioned, and that infrastructure retirements that are earlier than historical ones (or retrofits with carbon capture and storage technology) may be necessary, in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals. On the basis of the asset value per ton of committed emissions, we estimate that the most cost-effective premature infrastructure retirements will be in the electricity and industry sectors, if non-emitting alternative technologies are available and affordable.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-07-03 00:40:49,"c8hern","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,7,NA,"The nations that have signed agreements to stabilize the global mean temperature by 2050 will fail to meet their goals unless existing fossil fuel-burning infrastructure around the world is retired early, according to a study",1,7,0,2019-07-03 00:37:42,2019-07-03

For this to happen it seems governments need to accelerate development of small modular molten salt reactors, which are currently a ~decade away.

Existing nuclear reactors (PWR etc.) are just too expensive to install for a variety of reasons, and constructing such machines on-site is too error prone compared to the better quality control that could be achieved with mass production of SMRs. Iirc there are also significant limits to the manufacturing rate of PWR reactor vessels due to there only being a few facilities that can produce them due to the engineering requirements.","climate_science",2019-07-02 20:09:23,"c8blnq","deadhand-",0,6,0,TRUE,2013-12-20 05:14:52,0,19,802,21652,22473,36,NA,"""The studies agree that absent strong climate efforts, consumption grows '20–30% or more through 2040 and beyond, led largely by fossil fuels'...Renewables 'primarily add to, rather than displace, fossil fuels.'""",0.91,36,0,2019-07-02 16:51:21,2019-07-02

You think misinformed people have the power to shape nuanced shipping legislation? And their misinformation alone on shipping pollution will result in ineffective action on GW? Just wait until you see Fox news...

Also, 2.5% is substantial, and it's just one of many things. Go back and watch that first 'Inconvenient Truth' - Gore addresses all this with the pie chart diagram. Good things are good, right?   We need many reductions in emissions. 

Anyway, if you use generalizations like 'people now think' you're bound to be wrong at least some if the time. Personally, I think ""that...by doing something about shipping we can reduce gw pollution, which we need to do."" Do you think every person you're speaking of *actually* thought it would **just** take action on shipping? 

And, even if so, isn't that as good a place to start as any?

Here's a rough list of things I can recall:

1. People think the word _pollution_ is a synonym for greenhouse gases. It's gotten so bad that now we have the term _conventional pollution_ to refer to the actual pollution the EPA did battle with from its creation: SOx, NOx, particulates, unburned hydrocarbons, carcinogens, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, oil spills, chemical spills. Some people even believe plastic pollution causes global warming!
1. Some people think we should be ashamed of flying because of GHG emissions. All of global aviation is only responsible for about 2.5% of CO2 emissions, but now some people are demonizing all flying as if it were a major contributor.
1. People now think the US military is one of the biggest GHG emitters in the world, thanks to an inflammatory article that made the rounds recently. In fact using their own numbers shows that the US military is only responsible for 0.6% of CO2 emissions. It's true that that's more than the lowest 140 countries, but this says more about income inequality, not to mention the small populations of many countries.
1. People think shipping is one of the major GHG emitters in the world. This is related to my first point. Shipping currently uses something called _bunker fuel_ which has a lot of sulfur and burns very dirty, so large ships do emit a lot of pollution. But all of global shipping is only responsible for about 2.5% of CO2 emissions. The _pollution_ they emit is mostly in the form of soot, SOx, unburned hydrocarbons, and heavy metals, none of which have anything to do with global warming, except that SOx forms aerosols that block the sun and reduce global warming.
1. Many people think we only have 12 years to live. The recent IPCC report said that we need to be on track to have reduced CO2e emissions by 45% by 2030 if we are to stay at or below 1.5C of warming. That's all they said! But a lot of young people now are despondent over living in a world they think is going to be dead by 2030. 

There are a lot of problems with these misconceptions:

1. They distract from the real issues at hand. On an industrial scale, the low hanging fruit for reducing GHGs doesn't lie in small contributors like aviation, shipping, or the military, it lies in reducing coal use, and in massive installation of solar and wind power. Personally I think nuclear also has a large place in this, but I'm not married to that idea if something else is proved to be better.
1. Misconceptions about near-term effects can cause people to give up. If you only have 12, or now 11 years to live, why should you change anything?
1. Unscientific ideas make the 'good' side look ridiculous, and open us up to ridicule and recalcitrance from the other side.

I find this maddening, especially the righteousness of some of the science deniers in the global warming camp. Yes! I said _science deniers in the global warming camp_! Because that's what many of these people are, they deny clear science in favor of a puritanical approach to solving the problem of global warming.

"esjq9jz",4,"Sounds more like a dare than a serious question...  I'm not sure that's the kind of conversation I'm interested in having - but I'll give it one attempt. Let's start with your first point: 

&gt; People think the word pollution is a synonym for greenhouse gases. It's gotten so bad that now we have the term conventional pollution to refer to...

I know not everyone is familiar with the messaging and public perception war that has been ongoing around this issue for the last thirty years but I'm sure you'll agree that we haven't been winning it. It's important that you first understand that there are three major buckets of players around this issue: 1-people advocating for action on the issue (scientists, advocates, and knowledgeable sane people) 2-the broad lay public who haven't been trained in science or educated on the issue (frequently and effective mis-educated and dis-informed, in fact) and, 3- the opposition (Kochs, API, ACC, Fox, etc).

The problem is that the lay public isn't trained on the science, and formal efforts to provide effective communications about climate to them are swamped and inundated by dis-information from the opposition, which has dramatically more powerful communications channels and techniques. The lay public has a difficult time discerning fact from fiction on this issue, and who could blame them? They haven't been equipped with science training or information, and they have state-of-the-art propaganda, marketing, and disinformation techniques of immense scale arrayed against them. 

Here's how this has played out: initial understanding of global warming was buried by oil companies in the know, then, as academics and public researchers began to understand the problem they faced an uphill battle as they were trained to and were only communicating to students and other academics, hence their message had trouble gaining traction with the lay public. On the other hand, polluters hired Madison Avenue marketing firms and strategic communications consultants. Prominent scientists spent more than a decade with a knife at a gun fight, stubbornly speaking the wrong message from the wrong messenger to the wrong audience, while fossil fuel agents reached the right people in the right way such that awareness of global warming took a serious dip throughout the early-'aughts. These scientists wrung their hands, as you do, over being perfectly accurate and scientifically correct - while our opposition worried about being effective...

I'm not blaming these scientists, or others, but this issue has come a long way - and the twists and turns it's been through in the minds of the public are astounding. For example, the term 'global warming' had built an enormous head of steam (concern, fear) among the lay public around the time just before the first 'Inconvenient Truth' - but it was dashed by clever marketing: fossil fuel interests captured [a brilliant insight](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=72559699567970437507) from conservative messaging gurus, and dramatically moved away from the phrase 'global warming' - and to the phrase 'climate change'.  **Astoundingly, scientists and other pedants climbed aboard** (undoubtedly encouraged by provacatuers) because climate change is *technically* more correct. They just didn't realize they got tricked into losing all their momentum with the lay public...

This is all background and example; here's the point:

For decades the issue has been mired the unhelpful, jargon-y, and pedantic terms 'GHG emissions' and CO2, whatever that is... These terms inspire no worry, motivation, or anything other than a blank face from the lay public. Their eyes glaze over. You're almost as likely to hear that 'CO2 is what we exhale' or '*it's got what plants need*' when you mention it as you are to hear anything insightful - because of extremely effective opposition pr efforts. If you're waiting for *everyone* in the lay public to get a science degree so they can understand the nuance and be technically correct - then we're obviously dead in the water. 

Well, finally, scientists and advocates are now getting smart: you know what term is universally reviled by the public? What term elicits a deeply negative connotation? **Pollution.**  Universally effective messaging. 

So, scientists in-the-know and the greater movement have shifted dramatically to using resonant and effective messages, like 'global warming pollution' and 'coal-plant pollution' - to great effect, and let's hope it's not too late. 

However, you still hear the sticklers saying, 'well, that's not *technically* correct...' and I ask them: ""would you prefer to be technically correct and dead, or technically effective and alive?'

The lay public? Of course many people will get all this confused - but imo, you need to pick the right hill to die on. I might suggest your efforts at correcting people's technicalities may sometimes be better spent in other, more aligned ways. Mind you I'm not giving a pass to misinformation, but it helps to keep a sense of proportion and realistic expectations. 

Ok - that's just a quick take on one single point. Again, I have similar concerns with almost every point. 

Please receive this in the polite, friendly, and hopefully helpful tone as it is intended, and I'm happy to discuss further if you're interested. Also, and perhaps foremost, consider this information as coming from someone who works in this field and has *substantial* experience on this issue, as I have.

There are a lot of problems with these misconceptions:

1. They distract from the real issues at hand.

Personally I think nuclear also has a large place in this, but I'm not married to that idea if something else is proved to be better.

"esh1kgi",3,"NCAR’s CESM is ‘free’ and ‘accessible’ to anyone, but it is not exactly user-friendly and definitely not web-based for simplified civilian usage. You would need to spend at least a month or more just learning about how the model is built and playing around with different case setups before you are ready to play with the settings comfortably as you’re looking for. I would note that the documentation is also limited and a bit cryptic so going at this on your own would be genuinely difficult; a month is probably not enough time. 

Plus, these models don’t run on web browsers or the cloud, so you’ll need access to a supercomputer. Remember that the work that goes into a model is built upon decades of code/research and running models interactively on the web the way you want is a great idea but it would not be feasible for us to allocate funding resources to port a model to that environment. Us being model developers, people who range in various rolls/working groups. One thing that is nice about CESM is that it has a hierarchy of model setups built in, which is something you mention looking for, but I’m not sure how those go once you have a fully-coupled CMIP like simulation.

"esgwu4j",1,"&gt;Could we reduce an arbitrarily large amount of global warming by solar radiation management?

Like orbital shades?

Decreasing the sunlight to the planet is going to decrease photosynthesis, and so the entire productivity. The impact of that on ecosystems are unlikely to be a small perturbation in some cases.

&gt;Are there physical limits to how effective it would be?

I guess not. You could shade the whole planet if you deploy enough shades.

&gt;Is there a point where side effects become prohibitive?

Certainly. Plunge the entire planet into shadow, and you've strangled every ecosystem.

1. Some people think we should be ashamed of flying because of GHG emissions. All of global aviation is only responsible for about 2.5% of CO2 emissions, but now some people are demonizing all flying as if it were a major contributor.
1. People now think the US military is one of the biggest GHG emitters in the world, thanks to an inflammatory article that made the rounds recently. In fact using their own numbers shows that the US military is only responsible for 0.6% of CO2 emissions. It's true that that's more than the lowest 140 countries, but this says more about income inequality, not to mention the small populations of many countries.
1. People think shipping is one of the major GHG emitters in the world. This is related to my first point. Shipping currently uses something called _bunker fuel_ which has a lot of sulfur and burns very dirty, so large ships do emit a lot of pollution. But all of global shipping is only responsible for about 2.5% of CO2 emissions. The _pollution_ they emit is mostly in the form of soot, SOx, unburned hydrocarbons, and heavy metals, none of which have anything to do with global warming, except that SOx forms aerosols that block the sun and reduce global warming.
1. Many people think we only have 12 years to live. The recent IPCC report said that we need to be on track to have reduced CO2e emissions by 45% by 2030 if we are to stay at or below 1.5C of warming. That's all they said! But a lot of young people now are despondent over living in a world they think is going to be dead by 2030. 

There are a lot of problems with these misconceptions:

1. They distract from the real issues at hand. On an industrial scale, the low hanging fruit for reducing GHGs doesn't lie in small contributors like aviation, shipping, or the military, it lies in reducing coal use, and in massive installation of solar and wind power. Personally I think nuclear also has a large place in this, but I'm not married to that idea if something else is proved to be better.
1. Misconceptions about near-term effects can cause people to give up. If you only have 12, or now 11 years to live, why should you change anything?
1. Unscientific ideas make the 'good' side look ridiculous, and open us up to ridicule and recalcitrance from the other side.

I find this maddening, especially the righteousness of some of the science deniers in the global warming camp. Yes! I said _science deniers in the global warming camp_! Because that's what many of these people are, they deny clear science in favor of a puritanical approach to solving the problem of global warming. Many of them are as difficult to argue against as deniers, because if you dare contradict their edicts, you must be shamed and punished.

I spend more time correcting misconceptions among our own these days than I do with deniers. It seems like denial is dwindling, but irrationality is not. How can this be addressed in this age of fractured and siloed social media?

"eseiwfv",2,"&gt;From what I understand; Radiative forcing grows first with temperature growth following behind.

Well, temperature will grow so long as the radiative forcing remains. As the temperature of the earth increases its own radiation increases, and so eventually they balance again.

But there's a lot of water in the oceans, so it takes a long time for the temperature rise to finish getting to everywhere. But something in the 25-50 year time frame will see 60% of the temperature change due to an increase in long-lived greenhouse gas to manifest.

&gt;It takes time for temperature growth to catch up with forcing (decades, centuries, millenia depending on TCS or ECS?).

Sure. But if you think about it less as catch up, and more as the increase in temperature having turned on the heat. Like turning on an oven, and waiting for it to get up to temperature. Where it takes  a long time, because it's got a billion cubic kilometres of ocean in it. And 30 million cubic kilometres of ice.

&gt;For example, as methane is initially 120x more potent than CO2 but has a very short half-life, wouldn't this practically nullify the lag for this gas and add immediate warming?

It causes warming at a greater rate. But the time for the warming to have finished doesn't change, no matter the gas (or any other cause of radiative forcing ... an increase in solar irradiance perhaps.)

&gt;Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading?

Generally the greenhouse effect decreases with concentration of that greenhouse gas, because some of the heat trapped would have already been trapped. It's approximately logarithmic, so they talk about the climate sensitivity of greenhouse gasses in degrees per doubling, as opposed to degrees per increase. 

The difference in  potency between CH4 and CO2 is nearly completely due to this: CH4 is at much lower concentration, so it warms much more in the current earth's atmosphere.

So I guess the correct answer is it starts at the peak and degrades. But that's for a single burst of greenhouse emissions. The reality is that each year we emit more than the last.","climate_science",2019-06-30 13:13:59,"c725j1","ActuallyNot",0,2,0,TRUE,2010-06-10 19:04:03,176,43,5801,68124,74144,18,"To start off I simply want to say I'm not a denier or skeptic, I fully believe that anthropogenic climate change is causing more than 100% of the current global heating and that it will have severe consequences, but I am a layman who wants to learn more.

"" Could you please expand on what you mean by: Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading? "" - This was more an assumption based on what I'd heard and understood, I am willing to admit it could very well have been wrong. Basically from what I had understood, the growth of radiative forcing is non-linear due to the  GHG absorption, therefore it would eventually hit a ""peak"" before the gas starts to degrade in the atmosphere. So my understanding was that the absorption/radiative forcing of the gas would hit a peak, and thereafter begin to degrade in the atmosphere.

"ese1l0a",5,"Hi, to add to the other answers I've copied part of the second paragraph under the heading ""The thermal inertia of the oceans"" in this article (https://skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html)

""The reason the planet takes several decades to respond to increased CO2 is the thermal inertia of the oceans. Consider a saucepan of water placed on a gas stove. Although the flame has a temperature measured in hundreds of degrees C, the water takes a few minutes to reach boiling point. This simple analogy explains climate lag. The mass of the oceans is around 500 times that of the atmosphere. The time that it takes to warm up is measured in decades.""

So, the way I understand it is; carbon and methane contribute differently in time and intensity to radiative forcing. However, thermal lag still occurs regardless of where the radiative forcing is coming from. Remember the Earth's surface is ~70% covered by water. 
First the GHG molecule gets into the atmosphere, then it affects radiative forcing which increases the amount of long wave radiation reflected back to the Earth's surface. (See: earth energy budget) Then it takes awhile for that increased long wave radiation to be absorbed by the oceans/landforms and then have an effect on global temperature due to the scale of the  oceans buffering characteristics. (also see thermohaline circulation) 

Could you please expand on what you mean by:
Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading?
And also TCS? ECS? (Equilibrium climate sensitivity? Effective climate sensitivity?)

I hope this was helpful. Please let me know if you have any more questions or need clarification.

"escomgi",12,"When a GHG molecule enters the atmosphere, it starts warming the atmosphere by radiative forcing. It will continue to do so until it leaves the atmosphere. So while the GHG increases the rate of temperature increase AKA radiative forcing as soon as it enters, the extra heat takes time to build up.

The extra warming potential of CH4 means that that one individual molecule has a strong effect, but it lasts for only a couple years before it degrades, probably to CO2. So while one molecule has a rapid warming effect, the best way to think about it is in terms of the whole population of CH4. One molecule degrades fast, but we're adding CH4 so fast that it's concentration continues to build. That CH4 level will provide warming as long as it's around though, so it will carry the same sort of lag as CO2 in the atmosphere.

**Abstract**

The Hadley circulation has large climate impacts at low latitudes by transferring heat and moisture between the tropics and subtropics. Climate projections show a robust weakening of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley circulation by the end of the twenty-first century. Over the past several decades, however, atmospheric reanalyses indicate a strengthening of the Hadley circulation. Here we show that the strengthening of the circulation in the Northern Hemisphere is not seen in climate models; instead, these models simulate a weakening of the circulation in the past 40 years. Using observations and a large ensemble of model simulations we elucidate this discrepancy between climate models and reanalyses, and show that it does not stem from internal climate variability or biases in climate models, but appears related to artefacts in the representation of latent heating in the reanalyses. Our results highlight the role of anthropogenic emissions in the recent slowdown of the atmospheric circulation, which is projected to continue in coming decades, and question the reliability of reanalyses for estimating trends in the Hadley circulation.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-28 18:02:24,"c6nes1","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"Columbia Researchers Provide New Evidence on the Reliability of Climate Modeling",1,2,0,2019-06-28 18:01:15,2019-06-28

**Abstract**

Jakobshavn Isbrae has been the single largest source of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last 20 years. During that time, it has been retreating, accelerating and thinning. Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay’s upper 250 m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland. Longer time series of ocean temperature, subglacial discharge and glacier variability strongly suggest that ocean-induced melting at the front has continued to influence glacier dynamics after the disintegration of its floating tongue in 2003. We conclude that projections of Jakobshavn’s future contribution to sea-level rise that are based on glacier geometry are insufficient, and that accounting for external forcing is indispensable.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-28 16:11:57,"c6m2c8","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,9,NA,"In Greenland’s Melting Ice, A Warning on Hard Climate Choices",0.91,9,0,2019-06-28 16:10:42,2019-06-28

**Abstract**

It is generally accepted that animal heartbeat and lifespan are often inversely correlated, however, the relationship between productivity and longevity has not yet been described for trees growing under industrial and pre-industrial climates. Using 1768 annually resolved and absolutely dated ring width measurement series from living and dead conifers that grew in undisturbed, high-elevation sites in the Spanish Pyrenees and the Russian Altai over the past 2000 years, we test the hypothesis of grow fast—die young. We find maximum tree ages are significantly correlated with slow juvenile growth rates. We conclude, the interdependence between higher stem productivity, faster tree turnover, and shorter carbon residence time, reduces the capacity of forest ecosystems to store carbon under a climate warming-induced stimulation of tree growth at policy-relevant timescales.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-28 04:50:24,"c6fwfe","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,1,NA,"Amount of carbon stored in forests reduced as climate warms",1,1,0,2019-06-28 04:49:45,2019-06-28

**Abstract**



The climate impact of air traffic is to a large degree caused by changes in cirrus cloudiness resulting from the formation of contrails. Contrail cirrus radiative forcing is expected to increase significantly over time due to the large projected increases in air traffic. We use ECHAM5-CCMod, an atmospheric climate model with an online contrail cirrus parameterization including a microphysical two-moment scheme, to investigate the climate impact of contrail cirrus for the year 2050. We take into account the predicted increase in air traffic volume, changes in propulsion efficiency and emissions, in particular soot emissions, and the modification of the contrail cirrus climate impact due to anthropogenic climate change.

Global contrail cirrus radiative forcing increases by a factor of 3 from 2006 to 2050, reaching 160 or even 180 mW m^(−2), which is the result of the increase in air traffic volume and a slight shift in air traffic towards higher altitudes. Large increases in contrail cirrus radiative forcing are expected over all of the main air traffic areas, but relative increases are largest over main air traffic areas over eastern Asia. The projected upward shift in air traffic attenuates contrail cirrus radiative forcing increases in the midlatitudes but reinforces it in the tropical areas. Climate change has an insignificant impact on global contrail cirrus radiative forcing, while regional changes are significant. Of the emission reductions it is the soot number emission reductions by 50 % that lead to a significant decrease in contrail cirrus optical depth and coverage, leading to a decrease in radiative forcing by approximately 15 %. The strong increase in contrail cirrus radiative forcing due to the projected increase in air traffic volume cannot be compensated for by the decrease in initial ice crystal numbers due to reduced soot emissions and improvements in propulsion efficiency.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-27 22:42:39,"c6c5m5","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,9,NA,"Airplane Contrails' Climate Impact to Triple by 2050, Study Says - The clouds created by jet engine pollution have a surprisingly powerful short-term impact on global warming",1,9,0,2019-06-27 22:41:31,2019-06-27

**Abstract**

The Greenland Ice Sheet holds 7.2 m of sea level equivalent and in recent decades, rising temperatures have led to accelerated mass loss. Current ice margin recession is led by the retreat of outlet glaciers, large rivers of ice ending in narrow fjords that drain the interior. We pair an outlet glacier–resolving ice sheet model with a comprehensive uncertainty quantification to estimate Greenland’s contribution to sea level over the next millennium. We find that Greenland could contribute 5 to 33 cm to sea level by 2100, with discharge from outlet glaciers contributing 8 to 45% of total mass loss. Our analysis shows that uncertainties in projecting mass loss are dominated by uncertainties in climate scenarios and surface processes, whereas uncertainties in calving and frontal melt play a minor role. We project that Greenland will very likely become ice free within a millennium without substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-27 16:26:29,"c67l98","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"New research shows an iceless Greenland may be in the future.

"es2ouhb",23,"Firstly, CO2 concentrations can influnce the heat carrying of our atmosphere. Given all other variables remain, increasing CO2 concentration in a gaseous mix equivalent to earth's atmosphere will result in temperature increase.

Now that we've established that, there are of course other ways to heat up and cool down gases, and our atmosphere.

So the qeustion seems to be, if 150MYA there was a significant overall global temperature increase, was CO2 responsible, or was another variable if the CO2 concentration increases lag behind the temp?

However, there is an even more fundamtental question. Where does that graph come from? Is that data even reliable?

Let's take a look at that graph you provided. The website hosting it is ""[biocab.org](https://biocab.org)"", and their self-description is already somewhat alarming. They seem to see themselves as some kind of arbiter of truth, in a world dominated by the mis-use of knowledge. This ""truther"" type attitude is a bit odd if the source is, in fact, credible. However, we can't dismiss the data just beacsue its host appears unreliable, but at least we should take note of the red flags.

Fortunately the grpahs has provided their source/ reference - Scotese primarily, with some opther data sets added in. It seems that graphs is actually a hand-smoothed curve too, rather than an actual data plot.

"" *The ‘temperature’ record is a hand-drawn schematic derived from the work of Chris Scotese, and the CO2 graph is from a model that uses tectonic and chemical weathering histories to estimate CO2 levels* [*(Berner 1994;*](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/03/can-we-make-better-graphs-of-global-temperature-history/#ITEM-17010-0) [*Berner and Kothavala, 2001)*](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2014/03/can-we-make-better-graphs-of-global-temperature-history/#ITEM-17010-1)*.

As this site points out, there are actually a few versions of that data/ graph lurking about. The scales seems to get regularly changed too, which is a bit concerning:

**Abstract**

Recently, the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has become the main source of barystatic sea-level rise. The increase in the GrIS melt is linked to anticyclonic circulation anomalies, a reduction in cloud cover and enhanced warm-air advection. The Climate Model Intercomparison Project fifth phase (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs) do not capture recent circulation dynamics; therefore, regional climate models (RCMs) driven by GCMs still show significant uncertainties in future GrIS sea-level contribution, even within one emission scenario. Here, we use the RCM Modèle Atmosphèrique Règional to show that the modelled cloud water phase is the main source of disagreement among future GrIS melt projections. We show that, in the current climate, anticyclonic circulation results in more melting than under a neutral-circulation regime. However, we find that the GrIS longwave cloud radiative effect is extremely sensitive to the modelled cloud liquid-water path, which explains melt anomalies of +378 Gt yr^–1 (+1.04 mm yr^–1 global sea level equivalent) in a +2 °C-warmer climate with a neutral-circulation regime (equivalent to 21% more melt than under anticyclonic circulation). The discrepancies between modelled cloud properties within a high-emission scenario introduce larger uncertainties in projected melt volumes than the difference in melt between low- and high-emission scenarios.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-25 01:06:11,"c4zlxu","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,5,NA,"New research suggests that the representation of clouds in climate models is as, or more, important than the amount of greenhouse gas emissions when it comes to projecting future Greenland ice sheet melt.",1,5,0,2019-06-25 01:05:20,2019-06-25

For long term policy there is a strong tendency to focus on CO2 as this is a long lasting greenhouse gas. The shorter forcings both positive and negative such as aerosols and methane can largely be eliminated after 2 decades of ceasing to emit them (not quite but within reason for policy decisions) so there is a tendency to fix upon the major long lasting gas, CO2.

"ersvoju",10,"""Methane is 150x stronger than CO2 during it's initial years"" This is wrong. AR5 puts the initial potency of methane at 120x, 115x after 5 years, 86 after 20 years, so on so forth. However most of this is never realized due to methane degradation, so the initial potency is honestly pretty irrelevant when it doesn't tell us much about the forcing. In fact, the maximum potential forcing and temperature is most likely never even reached, even if there were to be some sudden, large and rapid methane pulse. This is also due to a lag, it takes time for temperature to catch up with forcing. And by the time it does, the methane would largely be degraded and out of the atmosphere. It does turn into CO2 and H2O, so it does add to the long-tail of climate risks.

Shakhova's work is good, but Hunziker doesn't make a good case for the doom of Earth. Sure, the ESAS may very well contain a lot of carbon, this isn't really disputed. What is disputed is how fast it could release. Shakhova and Semiletov stated a decade ago that ""50 gigatonnes could release"", but haven't made many more studies or claims such as this afterwards. It's hardly worth putting this much focus on a single claim in which they never stated the likelihood off of it.  [https://climatetippingpoints.info/2019/05/13/fact-check-is-an-arctic-methane-bomb-about-to-go-off/](https://climatetippingpoints.info/2019/05/13/fact-check-is-an-arctic-methane-bomb-about-to-go-off/) An earth scientist by the name of David A. McKay has looked into the studies and done some basic calculations around it.

And according to Atmospheric Scientist Ira Leifer, if a big burst of methane were to happen (He considers it unlikely) civilisation and humans would likely cope, with a lot of casualties. This plays into methanes short lifetime, nature and Earth is great at managing short perturbations (a few decades), but if you do it with CO2 for example (centuries to millenia) it's another story.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I find the article rather unconvincing, Hunziker seems to lack a lot of fundamental knowledge about the actual science and physics behind climate change and atmospheric gasses. It's fine that he wants to write about his own opinion, but he seems to almost have a cult-like fanaticism to his focus on the methane ""bomb"". He also links to the fringe group Arctic News and not really reliable as a source. They're not scientists and have childish ideas of a 18C rise in temperature by 2026, which is most likely not even physically possible.

**Abstract**

Climate warming in regions of ice‐rich permafrost can result in widespread thermokarst development, which reconfigures the landscape and damages infrastructure. We present multi‐site time‐series observations which couple ground temperature measurements with thermokarst development in a region of very cold permafrost. In the Canadian High Arctic between 2003 and 2016, a series of anomalously warm summers caused mean thawing indices to be 150 – 240 % above the 1979‐2000 normal resulting in up to 90 cm of subsidence over the 12‐year observation period. Our data illustrate that despite low mean annual ground temperatures, very cold permafrost (&lt;‐10°C) with massive ground ice close to the surface is highly vulnerable to rapid permafrost degradation and thermokarst development. We suggest that this is due to little thermal buffering from soil organic layers and near surface vegetation, and the presence of near surface ground ice. Observed maximum thaw depths at our sites are already exceeding those projected to occur by 2090 under RCP 4.5.

**Key Points**

- Observed thermokarst development in very cold permafrost at 3 monitoring sites along a 700 km transect in the Canadian High Arctic.

**Abstract**

This paper examines the US military's impact on climate by analysing the geopolitical ecology of its global logistical supply chains. Our geopolitical ecology framework interrogates the material‐ecological metabolic flows (hydrocarbon‐based fuels, water, sand, concrete) that shape geopolitical and geoeconomic power relations. We argue that to account for the US military as a major climate actor, one must understand the logistical supply chain that makes its acquisition and consumption of hydrocarbon‐based fuels possible. Our paper focuses on the US Defense Logistics Agency – Energy (DLA‐E), a large yet virtually unresearched sub‐agency within the US Department of Defense. The DLA‐E is the primary purchase‐point for hydrocarbon‐based fuels for the US military, as well as a powerful actor in the global oil market. After outlining our geopolitical ecology approach, we detail the scope of the DLA‐E's operations, its supply chain, bureaucratic practices, and the physical infrastructure that facilitates the US military's consumption of hydro‐based carbons on a global scale. We show several “path dependencies” – warfighting paradigms, weapons systems, bureaucratic requirements, and waste – that are put in place by military supply chains and undergird a heavy reliance on carbon‐based fuels by the US military for years to come. The paper, based on comprehensive records of bulk fuel purchases we have gathered from DLA‐E through Freedom of Information Act requests, represents a partial yet robust picture of the geopolitical ecology of American imperialism.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-20 03:03:12,"c2pwlo","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,16,NA,"Research shows the US military is one of the largest climate polluters in history, consuming more liquid fuels and emitting more CO2e (carbon-dioxide equivalent) than most countries.",0.95,16,0,2019-06-20 01:51:13,2019-06-20

____

**Plain Language Summary**

The Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum, characterized by a relatively rapid carbon release to the atmosphere and global warming, has received ample scientific attention owing to its analogy to ongoing climate change. We perform Earth system model projections of concomitant changes in climate, ocean circulation, and marine biogeochemical cycles during the onset of the Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum. In our simulations global warming (induced by atmospheric emissions of CO2) leads to a weakening of the meridional overturning circulation and reduced ventilation of the ocean interior which is more pronounced in the Atlantic than in the Pacific Ocean. As a result of this ocean stagnation, respiratory CO2 released via bacterial remineralization of organic matter (oxygen is thereby consumed) builds up in intermediate waters. This triggers carbonate dissolution and deoxygenation. This mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the asymmetry in the carbonate dissolution proxy record between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

**Abstract**

The Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum was a transient, carbon‐induced global warming event, considered the closest analog to ongoing climate change. Impacts of a decrease in deepwater formation during the onset of the Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum suggested by proxy data on the carbon cycle are not yet fully understood. Using an Earth System Model, we find that changes in overturning circulation are key to reproduce the deoxygenation and carbonate dissolution record. Weakening of the Southern Ocean deepwater formation and enhancement of ocean stratification driven by warming cause an asymmetry in carbonate dissolution between the Atlantic and Pacific basins suggested by proxy data. Reduced ventilation results in accumulation of remineralization products (CO2 and nutrients) in intermediate waters, thereby lowering O2 and increasing CO2. As a result, carbonate dissolution is triggered throughout the water column, while the ocean surface remains supersaturated. Our findings contribute to understanding of the long‐term response of the carbon cycle to climate change.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-20 01:40:07,"c2prsj","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"A new study addresses a key PETM mystery: why ocean acidification appears to have occurred to a greater degree in the Atlantic than in the Pacific Ocean.

____

**Abstract**



The Arctic Ocean is projected to become seasonally ice‐free before midcentury unless greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly reduced, but exactly when this could occur depends considerably on internal climate variability. Here we show that trajectories to an ice‐free Arctic are modulated by concomitant shifts in the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Trajectories starting in the negative IPO phase become ice‐free 7 years sooner than those starting in the positive IPO phase. Trajectories starting in the negative IPO phase subsequently transition toward the positive IPO phase, on average, with an associated strengthening of the Aleutian Low, increased poleward energy transport, and faster sea‐ice loss. The observed IPO began to transition away from its negative phase in the past few years. If this shift continues, our results suggest increased likelihood of accelerated sea‐ice loss over the coming decades, and an increased risk of an ice‐free Arctic within the next 20–30 years.

**Plain Language Summary**

Manmade climate change is causing a rapid loss of Arctic sea ice. Summer Arctic sea ice is predicted to disappear almost completely by the middle of this century, unless emissions of greenhouse gases are rapidly reduced. The speed of sea‐ice loss is not constant over time, however. Natural climate variability can add to the manmade decline, leading to faster sea‐ice loss, or can subtract from the manmade decline, leading to slower sea‐ice loss. In this study, we looked at how natural climate variability affects the timing of an ice‐free Arctic. We found that a natural cycle called the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, or IPO for short, is particularly important. Arctic sea‐ice loss is faster when the IPO is moving from its cold to warm phase and slower when the IPO is moving from its warm to cold phase. This is because variations in the IPO cause changes in atmospheric wind patterns, which alter the amount of heat that is transported into the Arctic. Observations show that the IPO started to shift from its cold to warm phase in the past few years. If this shift continues, our results suggest that there is an increased chance of accelerated sea‐ice loss over the coming decades.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-20 01:32:15,"c2pout","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,5,NA,"Unless emissions of greenhouse gases are rapidly reduced, summer Arctic sea ice is predicted to disappear almost completely by the middle of this century (closer to 2030 than 2050) as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, or IPO for short, continues to shift to its warm phase.",1,5,0,2019-06-20 01:31:01,2019-06-20
"erlqk2u",1,"Abstract: Destabilization of intrapermafrost gas hydrate is one possible reason for methane emission on the Arctic shelf. The formation of these intrapermafrost gas hydrates could occur almost simultaneously with the permafrost sediments due to the occurrence of a hydrate stability zone after sea regression and the subsequent deep cooling and freezing of sediments. The top of the gas hydrate stability zone could exist not only at depths of 200–250 m, but also higher due to local pressure increase in gas-saturated horizons during freezing. Formed at a shallow depth, intrapermafrost gas hydrates could later be preserved and transform into a metastable (relict) state. Under the conditions of submarine permafrost degradation, exactly relict hydrates located above the modern gas hydrate stability zone will, first of all, be involved in the decomposition process caused by negative temperature rising, permafrost thawing, and sediment salinity increasing. That’s why special experiments were conducted on the interaction of frozen sandy sediments containing relict methane hydrates with salt solutions of different concentrations at negative temperatures to assess the conditions of intrapermafrost gas hydrates dissociation. Experiments showed that the migration of salts into frozen hydrate-containing sediments activates the decomposition of pore gas hydrates and increase the methane emission. These results allowed for an understanding of the mechanism of massive methane release from bottom sediments of the East Siberian Arctic shelf.","climate_science",2019-06-20 01:30:30,"c2poao","KeybladeAxel19",0,1,0,TRUE,2015-05-28 01:35:48,124,0,2231,146,2501,3,NA,"Role of Salt Migration in Destabilization of Intra Permafrost Hydrates in the Arctic shelf: Experimental Modeling",1,3,0,2019-06-20 01:29:32,2019-06-20

There are many problems that are ""more immediate"" but none that are larger in size. We are talking about a mass die off of people. The more deaths in heatwaves is just a tiny, tiny part of it.

"erkyvi5",11,"This is a *very dense*, *very informative* consensus statement. There is an incredible amount of information here, but I'll put some select quotes below:

&gt;Diatoms perform 25–45% of total primary production in the oceans60,61,62, owing to their prevalence in open-ocean regions when total phytoplankton biomass is maximal63. Diatoms have relatively high sinking speeds compared with other phytoplankton groups, and they account for ~40% of particulate carbon export to depth62,64. Physically driven seasonal enrichments in surface nutrients favour diatom blooms. Anthropogenic climate change will directly affect these seasonal cycles, changing the timing of blooms and diminishing their biomass, which will reduce primary production and CO2 uptake65. Remote sensing data suggest a global decline of diatoms between 1998 and 2012, particularly in the North Pacific, which is associated with shallowing of the surface mixed layer and lower nutrient concentrations46.

and

&gt;Vegetated coastal habitats are important for carbon sequestration, determined by the full trophic spectrum from predators to herbivores, to plants and their associated microbial communities85. Human activity, including anthropogenic climate change, has reduced these habitats over the past 50 years by 25–50%, and the abundance of marine predators has dropped by up to 90%

and

&gt;Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) have expanded in the past 50 years as a result of ocean warming, which reduces oxygen solubility73,74,75. OMZs are global sinks for reactive nitrogen, and microbial production of N2 and N2O accounts for ~25–50% of nitrogen loss from the ocean to the atmosphere. Furthermore, OMZs are the largest pelagic methane reservoirs in the ocean and contribute substantially to open ocean methane cycling. The observed and predicted future expansion of OMZs may therefore considerably affect ocean nutrient and greenhouse gas budgets, and the distributions of oxygen-dependent organisms7
and

&gt;Nevertheless, predictions from global assessments of responses to warming indicate that terrestrial carbon loss under warming is causing a positive feedback that will accelerate the rate of climate change143, particularly in cold and temperate soils, which store much of the global soil carbon147.

and

&gt;If access is taken into account, increasing atmospheric CO2 levels are predicted to allow greater microbial decomposition and less soil retention of organic carbon162.

and

&gt;Elevated CO2 concentrations enhance competition for nitrogen between plants and microorganisms163. Herbivores (invertebrates and mammals) affect the amount of organic matter that is returned to soil and thereby microbial biomass and activity164. For example, grasshoppers diminish plant biomass and plant nitrogen demand, thereby increasing microbial activity163. Climate change can reduce herbivory, resulting in overall alterations to global nitrogen and carbon cycles that reduce terrestrial carbon sequestration163.

and

&gt;Climate change is predicted to increase the rate of antibiotic resistance of some human pathogens236. Data from 2013–2015 suggest that an increase of the daily minimum temperature by 10 °C (which is conceivable for some parts of the USA by the end of the century) will lead to an increase in antibiotic resistance rates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by 2–4% (up to 10% for certain antibiotics)

and finally 

&gt;Across marine and terrestrial biomes, microbially driven greenhouse gas emissions are increasing and positively feeding back on climate change. Irrespective of the fine details, the microbial compass points to the need to act (Box 2). Ignorance of the role of, effects on and feedback response of microbial communities to climate change can lead to our own peril. An immediate, sustained and concerted effort is required to explicitly include microorganisms in research, technology development, and policy and management decisions. Microorganisms not only contribute to the rate of climate change but can also contribute immensely to its effective mitigation and our adaptation tools.","climate_science",2019-06-19 20:01:17,"c2lu2s","TheNewN0rmal",0,11,0,FALSE,NA,25,0,0,0,25,62,NA,"Scientists’ warning to humanity: microorganisms and climate change",0.97,62,0,2019-06-19 19:57:32,2019-06-19

"erjrvb2",5,"There are regional models which cover global regions like north america, for example, so these are quite large. Downscaling these models usually happens with various organisations within a country. For example, in Canada, we have a few NGOs that do this, for example, the Pacific Climate Impact Consortium. Also, the federal government is working on a national portal to bring these downscaled impacts together and easier to search and understand.

So basically what you're asking about is being done, slowly, because it is quite difficult, requiring lots of data and computer power to run models. There are some general rules of thumb emerging, for instance, that currently dry areas will get drier, and wet ones, wetter - although I would bet there will be exceptions. Of course, as you mentioned, many areas will be submerged from ice melt, although some areas will rise. This is due continental glacial rebound, I.e. glaciers currently weighing down on land area will stop putting that downward pressure on the land mass as it melts, thus allowing the land mass to rise, which can reduce or overtake sea level rise in some cases.

This paper summarizes current understanding of the processes that determine the dynamics of the subsea permafrost–hydrate system existing in the largest, shallowest shelf in the Arctic Ocean; the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). We review key environmental factors and mechanisms that determine formation, current dynamics, and thermal state of subsea permafrost, mechanisms of its destabilization, and rates of its thawing; a full section of this paper is devoted to this topic. Another important question regards the possible existence of permafrost-related hydrates at shallow ground depth and in the shallow shelf environment. We review the history of and earlier insights about the topic followed by an extensive review of experimental work to establish the physics of shallow Arctic hydrates. We also provide a principal (simplified) scheme explaining the normal and altered dynamics of the permafrost–hydrate system as glacial–interglacial climate epochs alternate. We also review specific features of methane releases determined by the current state of the subsea-permafrost system and possible future dynamics. This review presents methane results obtained in the ESAS during two periods: 1994–2000 and 2003–2017. A final section is devoted to discussing future work that is required to achieve an improved understanding of the subject.","climate_science",2019-06-18 21:14:42,"c27zdh","[deleted]",0,1,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,16,NA,"New S&amp;S paper; Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf",0.85,16,0,2019-06-18 21:14:33,2019-06-18

**Abstract**

Fluctuations in glacier motion are very common and are thought to be controlled by subglacial hydrology and till deformation. There are few instrumented studies that have monitored seasonal changes. We use the innovative Glacsweb subglacial in situ wireless probes, combined with dGPS and custom geophone data from an Icelandic soft-bedded temperate glacier, to show that there are two distinct seasonal styles of speed-up events. Relatively small diurnal events occur during the melt season, whilst during winter there are larger multi-day events related to positive degree days. These events are accompanied by a distinct pattern of till deformation and basal icequakes. We argue these reflect stick-slip motion which occurs when the glacier hydrological system is unable to accommodate the melt water flux generated by surface melt episodes. We show a rare fully instrumented coupled glacier/till record of contrasting summer and winter stick-slip motion and discuss its implication for till sedimentology.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-18 02:12:53,"c1wgcj","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,6,NA,"Research examines new links between retreating glaciers and global warming",0.88,6,0,2019-06-18 02:11:55,2019-06-18

"erbbsdk",1,"Methane release times are likely to be on the order of a century or longer, so you're unlikely to see the effect of all the methane dumped into the atmosphere at once.

The more methane you add, the less the effect of adding any given amount, so you can't simply multiply the amount you add times the current effect of adding a small amount.

Yes, the methane gets oxidized before you see the full temperature impact, even if you add it all at once.

There are some factors which seem to increase sensitivity as you move farther away from normal.

Methane lives longer the more you have, although this seems to be overemphasized in my opinion because destruction by tropical lightning isn't remotely close to saturated.

The clouds used in climate models are generated by parameterizations generated by observations around current values.  
We can increasingly simulate these clouds directly on small scales (not climate model scales).  This seems to indicate that the values used in climate models are wrong in climates much warmer than currently exist.  This seems to indicate that past a certain level of global warmth, you get a sizeable abrupt upward shift in global temperatures associated with the disappearance of temperate marine cloud decks.  This seems to be necessary to explain the warm poles with not greatly warmer tropics during the time of the dinosaurs, which climate models have long had trouble explaining.

"erag5g2",1,"Yes , there is a lag between forcing and temperature change.  Generally you're getting around 50% after a few months, with a gradual warming continuing over centuries.  The thing is, this lag relative to forcing is quite similar for methane and for CO2, even if the time distribution of forcing is different.  GWPs are defined as a ratio to the CO2 warming, so the delays come close to canceling out for GWP measures.

Also, don't forget saturation.  Even if you somehow get a large rapid pulse, the forcing is much less than linear because the absorption lines get opaque.  Generally they use an approximation of forcing as the square root of concentration for methane, as opposed to log of concentration for CO2.

There indications of possible major problems with temperate marine cloud parameterizations at very high forcing levels, if you want to look at Cretaceous-like climates, but the forcing can't be anywhere close to linear.","climate_science",2019-06-15 23:57:16,"bzmklc","ShyElf",0,1,0,TRUE,2014-11-14 02:59:39,0,0,26,38408,38434,5,"Hi.

As I understand it, scientists estimate past CO2 levels by taking ice core data.  They take the ice cores, sample the CO2 level in a certain section, so they can say that the CO2 ppm was ""so and so"" this many years ago.  

But how are current CO2 measurements taken?  The way I see it (and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), there are two ways to get comparable data from today.  

1) take ice core samples from the present day (1950-present), and use that as your CO2 benchmark  

2) ascertain that air samples (like ones from Mauna Loa) are equivalent to ice core samples in terms of CO2 concentration.  I imagine this could be done by letting water freeze in several chambers that vary by CO2 level, and then testing the CO2 level of the ice.  

If anyone could confirm that one of these is true, (or quell my doubt in any other way) I would appreciate it.  It doesn't strike me as trivial that the CO2 level of an ice core would necessarily be equivalent to the CO2 level of the ambient air at the time of freezing.","Question about the validity of CO2 ppm measurements?",1,2,0,2019-06-15 02:01:42,2019-06-15

Never mind the fishing industry, which is obviously right on the coast: how many fishermen will go out of business or lose their homes and be forced to move inland?

Now, modern farmers and fish tycoons and people in general are pretty smart at figuring this sort of thing out. But they'll *also* be dealing with the refugee crisis and its economic and political consequences—which will only be worsened if we see any kind of food shortages.

I've only named a couple of problems, but already it's easy to see how they could spiral completely out of control if they get bad enough.

Global warming and sea level rise are two consistent consequences of greenhouse gas emissions. Rising temperatures means the thermal expansion of the ocean and melting of land ice, both of which make sea level rise faster. Other things you might hear about are also consistent with rising temperatures, like stronger hurricanes and heavier rainfall from thunderstorms.

**Highlights**

 • Bitcoin's annual electricity consumption adds up to 45.8 TWh

 • The corresponding annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO2

 • This level sits between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka

**Context &amp; Scale**

Blockchain technology has its roots in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which was the first successful attempt to validate transactions via a decentralized data protocol. This validation process requires vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant level of carbon emissions. Our approximation of Bitcoin’s carbon footprint underlines the need to tackle the environmental externalities that result from cryptocurrencies.
Blockchain solutions are increasingly discussed for a broad variety of use cases beyond cryptocurrencies. Although not all blockchain protocols are as energy intensive as Bitcoin’s protocol, environmental aspects, the risk of collusion, and concerns about control must not be ignored in the debate on anticipated benefits. Our findings for the first stage of blockchain diffusion and the externalities we discuss may help policy-makers in setting the right rules as the adoption journey of blockchain technology has just started.

**Summary**

Participation in the Bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialized hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin’s blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO2. This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-13 18:14:32,"c097rw","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,23,NA,"The use of Bitcoin causes around 22 megatons in carbon dioxide emissions annually, comparable to the total emissions of cities such as Las Vegas or Hamburg.",0.93,23,0,2019-06-13 18:08:13,2019-06-13

I'm no expert but I would look for small towns with lots of nearby natural resources (water and trees), with a strong sense of identity, a diverse employer base (not based around one single company / industry), a place where people know each other and take care of each other, where you and your family will be accepted based on the community's norms so you won't be treated as outsiders, and where the residents frequently interact with each other outside of their steel cage automobiles.

Everyone is different, but if you are able to save cash while still paying off the student loans, personally I would rather have the cash. Cash gives you options - invest in a local business you believe in, make a down payment on a house, pay off the loans in a lump sum - options are nice to have.

"eqxcopt",1,"Study (open access): [Global ensemble projections reveal trophic amplification of ocean biomass declines with climate change](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/06/10/1900194116)
____

**Significance**

Climate change can affect the distribution and abundance of marine life, with consequences for goods and services provided to people. Because different models can lead to divergent conclusions about marine futures, we present an integrated global ocean assessment of climate change impacts using an ensemble of multiple climate and ecosystem models. It reveals that global marine animal biomass will decline under all emission scenarios, driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production. Notably, climate change impacts are amplified at higher food web levels compared with phytoplankton. Our ensemble projections provide the most comprehensive outlook on potential climate-driven ecological changes in the global ocean to date and can inform adaptive management and conservation of marine resources under climate change.

**Abstract**

While the physical dimensions of climate change are now routinely assessed through multimodel intercomparisons, projected impacts on the global ocean ecosystem generally rely on individual models with a specific set of assumptions. To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5% (±4% SD) under low emissions and 17% (±11% SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5% decline for every 1 °C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels, a process known as trophic amplification. Fishing did not substantially alter the effects of climate change. Considerable regional variation featured strong biomass increases at high latitudes and decreases at middle to low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to variations in marine ecosystem and Earth system models were similar. Ensemble projections performed well compared with empirical data, emphasizing the benefits of multimodel inference to project future outcomes. Our results indicate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that these impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels. Next steps for model development include dynamic scenarios of fishing, cumulative human impacts, and the effects of management measures on future ocean biomass trends.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-12 19:28:12,"bzviuk","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,15,NA,"Marine life decreases by 5 % with every 1 °C increase in the temperature of the oceans, according to a new study.

**Abstract**

Extremely high temperatures pose an immediate threat to humans and ecosystems. In recent years, many regions on land and in the ocean experienced heatwaves with devastating impacts that would have been highly unlikely without human‐induced climate change. Impacts are particularly severe when heatwaves occur in regions with high exposure of people or crops. The recent 2018 spring‐to‐summer season was characterized by several major heat and dry extremes. On daily average between May and July 2018 about 22% of the populated and agricultural areas north of 30 degrees latitude experienced concurrent hot temperature extremes. Events of this type were unprecedented prior to 2010, while similar conditions were experienced in the 2010 and 2012 boreal summers. Earth System Model (ESM) simulations of present‐day climate, that is, at around +1°C global warming, also display an increase of concurrent heat extremes. Based on ESM simulations we show that it is virtually certain} (using IPCC calibrated uncertainty language) that the 2018 North‐Hemispheric concurrent heat events would not have occurred without human‐induced climate change. Our results further reveal that the average high‐exposure area projected to experience concurrent warm and hot spells in the Northern Hemisphere increases by about 16% per additional +1°C of global warming.

"eqtbhlg",7,"Well who knows what the future holds - people have been trying to predict it forever and haven't got there yet. 
It's still a good topic worth discussing though. Personally I am not paying my house off early because I am putting those funds towards preparations instead.  

Preparations include: things that will be useful when energy is more expensive and less readily available (insulation, efficient windows, whole house fan instead of air conditioning, solar panels), ways to produce food in the yard (garden, fruit trees, chicken coop, rabbit hutch), ways to save and store water (jugs, wide gutters and rain barrels), security that doesn't require electricity (reinforced locks, solar lights) and methods to cook and heat the home without electric or gas inputs (wood stove).  

Some will argue that you should be debt-free including a mortgage so that your house and land aren't foreclosed on and repossessed by the bank in the event of a market crash. I can see the support for that argument, but my perspective is that if things get that bad then the banks won't be able to enforce foreclosures - either because the banks won't be operating, or law enforcement will have bigger problems than processing evictions.  

As another in a similar age group, I am not counting on the stock market and social security providing anything 30 years from now. Call me a hypocrite because I still contribute to my work's 401k, so I will have the opportunity to be pleasantly surprised if it happens that I can cash out at 59.5.  

The last piece of the strategy is to vote with your dollars to help create a better world. Even if things don't turn out quite like you predict, these are things that will strengthen your part of the world -- buy local, buy things made in your own region and country, buy things that are reusable, buy food from nearby farmer's markets rather than the big box megastore that imports everything, buy a six pack to share with your neighbors instead of spending it on video games...

"eqsvvu6",14,"This is a great topic for discussion. Thanks for starting it.  


I don't feel like I have all of the answers, and I look forward to seeing what others are doing, but here's where I'm at.  


We have bought a plain house that suits our simple needs (for a family of 5) and isn't extravagant. We will be able to pay it off reasonably quickly, and much faster than if we had borrowed all the bank would have let us have.  


We have a little bit of space around our block and have the opportunity for some guerilla gardening. We've planted a few fruit trees on the surrounding land since we moved in 18 months ago. I figure these will take time to grow and start producing a good crop, and that planting fruit trees is something that is better to do now rather than later. We have also started to care for the fruit trees others have planted in the past. They are well established and so don't need watering, but were very overgrown and needed a good pruning. It might take them a year or two to recover at this point, but then they will produce even better.  


We are also looking at buying a small parcel of surrounding land to grow more vegetables. On that topic, I've dabbled for a few years now in growing vegetables. Five years ago we moved to a new climate, so I've worked to learn what works here. I still buy the bulk of our vegetables from the supermarket as it is more cost effective, but I am building the skills so that if I did have to ramp up production at home I should have some success and knowledge.  


We work to keep our wants simple and expenses low. Controlling desires is very important. I also find it very useful to stop before making a purchase and take some time to see if I can come up with a clever alternative or fix for what I am thinking of purchasing. I believe ingenuity will be important in the future. I also try to develop this in our children. They will need to be adaptable problem solvers to have the best shot.  


Although we have purchased a property I also try to have a mindset of being ready to up sticks and move on. At this stage I am not convinced that setting ourselves up for one location is the best option. I think it is better to be prepared to be transient and see how things pan out then make the best choices you can at that time, with what is happening at that time and the information you have at that time. We are making some changes here, such as better insulation (cold climate) and planting those fruit trees, but I am not ready to invest everything in this one shot.  


We are also working on improving our physical fitness and staying healthy. I feel so grateful to live in a time of excellent medical care, but I am not convinced the system won't become over stretched in the future. We need to do what we can to care for our bodies. I think general good health and some physical ability will also make it easier to grow food, walk where we need, generally adapt.

I might reply again later when more comes to mind.","climate_discussion",2019-06-11 23:20:00,"bzinsc","rplej",0,14,0,TRUE,2017-09-21 22:51:03,70,12,232,17250,17564,32,"Has anyone started preparing logistically?

**Abstract**

In the past, human migrations have been associated with climate change. As our civilizations developed, humans depended less on the environment, in particular on climate, because technological and economic development in the span of human history allowed us to adapt to and overcome environmental discomfort. Asian Russia (east of the Urals to the Pacific) is known to be sparsely populated. The population is concentrated along the forest-steppe in the south, with its comfortable climate and thriving agriculture on fertile soils. We use current and predicted climate scenarios to evaluate the climate comfort of various landscapes to determine the potential for human settlers throughout the 21st century. Climate change scenarios are taken from 20 CMIP5 general circulation models. Two CO2 Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios, RCP 2.6 representing mild climate change and RCP 8.5 representing more extreme changes, are applied to the large subcontinental territory of Asian Russia. The ensemble January and July temperature anomaly means and annual precipitation are calculated with respect to the baseline 1961–1990 climate. Three climate indices, which are important for human livelihood and well-being, are calculated based on January and July temperatures and annual precipitation: Ecological Landscape Potential, winter severity, and permafrost coverage. Climates predicted by the 2080s over Asian Russia would be much warmer and milder. Ensemble means do not show extreme aridity. The permafrost zone is predicted to significantly shift to the northeast. Ecological Landscape Potential would increase 1–2 categories from 'low' to 'relatively high' which would result in a higher capacity for population density across Asian Russia. Socio-economic processes and policy choices will compel the development that will lead to attracting people to migrate throughout the century. Therefore, understanding ecological landscape potential is crucial information for developing viable strategies for long-term economic and social development in preparation for climate migration and strategic adaptation planning.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-11 06:12:46,"bz8ul8","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,4,NA,"Large parts of Asian Russia could become more habitable by the late 21st century due to climate change, new research has found.",0.84,4,0,2019-06-11 06:11:40,2019-06-11

Doesn't really matter how likely it is that it'll work.

&amp;#x200B;

I will say: from what I've been researching, that methane emission paper you're talking about says that the emissions from US INDUSTRY are potentially a hundred times higher. Specifically, they found the US fertilizer industry's reported methane emissions - through the six fertilizer plants that they were studying - were inaccurate to what was actually emitted, as well as inaccurate to what the EPA was saying the country's leaked methane emissions were (here's the actual scientific paper, for reference [https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.358/](https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.358/)). If that's true, then what else are the EPA and individual industries 'looking the other way' for when they report their emissions?

&gt;""The team found that 0.34% of the gas used in the plants \[in the United States\] ends up in the atmosphere - scaled up across the entire industry, this suggests total annual methane emissions would total 28 gigagrams, vastly exceeding the 0.2 gigagrams reported by the sector.""

[https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/06/07/methane-emissions-from-us-industry-100-times-higher-than-reported/](https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/06/07/methane-emissions-from-us-industry-100-times-higher-than-reported/)

&amp;#x200B;

That's still disturbing news, but it's only changing where we understand the current methane level increases - current levels are around 1,866 PPB, if the 2 Degree Institute is right with their numbers [https://www.methanelevels.org/](https://www.methanelevels.org/)  \-  are *actually* coming from. It's not reporting a new/unexpected increase in the level of methane in the atmosphere, but focusing on exactly what's causing that methane level we already know about to rise so fast... and how cowardly government and company officials can be in taking responsibility for corporate emissions. In a way, that's decent news because it's putting more of those emissions on human shoulders; they're in the atmosphere specifically, *directly* because of our doing, and our interference can change how much they emit (for better or worse). Because they're at fertilizer plants that doesn't make it easy to change, but... still.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm understanding it, you could say something similar for these Nitrous Oxide emissions from permafrost. It's not good news, but we're learning exactly what part of the current rise in Nitrous Oxide levels to 331 Parts-Per-Billion - [https://www.n2olevels.org/](https://www.n2olevels.org/) \- is coming from specific sources.

____

**Abstract**

Mass mortality events are increasing in frequency and magnitude, potentially linked with ongoing climate change. In October 2016 through January 2017, St. Paul Island, Bering Sea, Alaska, experienced a mortality event of alcids (family: Alcidae), with over 350 carcasses recovered. Almost three-quarters of the carcasses were unscavenged, a rate much higher than in baseline surveys (17%), suggesting ongoing deposition and elevated mortality around St Paul over a 2–3 month period. Based on the observation that carcasses were not observed on the neighboring island of St. George, we bounded the at-sea distribution of moribund birds, and estimated all species mortality at 3,150 to 8,800 birds. The event was particularly anomalous given the late fall/winter timing when low numbers of beached birds are typical. In addition, the predominance of Tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata, 79% of carcass finds) and Crested auklets (Aethia cristatella, 11% of carcass finds) was unusual, as these species are nearly absent from long-term baseline surveys. Collected specimens were severely emaciated, suggesting starvation as the ultimate cause of mortality. The majority (95%, N = 245) of Tufted puffins were adults regrowing flight feathers, indicating a potential contribution of molt stress. Immediately prior to this event, shifts in zooplankton community composition and in forage fish distribution and energy density were documented in the eastern Bering Sea following a period of elevated sea surface temperatures, evidence cumulatively suggestive of a bottom-up shift in seabird prey availability. We posit that shifts in prey composition and/or distribution, combined with the onset of molt, resulted in this mortality event.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-06-03 05:05:51,"bw3dc9","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,17,NA,"Mass die-offs of puffins in Alaska may be linked to climate change",0.89,17,0,2019-06-02 22:47:42,2019-06-02

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;The process of CO2 valorization—from capture of CO2 to its electrochemical upgrade—requires significant inputs in each of the capture, upgrade, and separation steps. Here we report an electrolyzer that upgrades carbonate electrolyte from CO2 capture solution to syngas, achieving 100% carbon utilization across the system. A bipolar membrane is used to produce proton in situ to facilitate CO2 release at the membrane:catalyst interface from the carbonate solution. Using a Ag catalyst, we generate syngas at a 3:1 H2:CO ratio, and the product is not diluted by CO2 at the gas outlet; we generate this pure syngas product stream at a current density of 150 mA/cm2 and an energy efficiency of 35%. The carbonate-to-syngas system is stable under a continuous 145 h of catalytic operation. The work demonstrates the benefits of coupling CO2 electrolysis with a CO2 capture electrolyte on the path to practicable CO2 conversion technologies.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-31 02:12:41,"bv1smd","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,12,NA,"A research team from U of T Engineering has developed a new electrochemical path to transform carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products such as jet fuel or plastics.

Facts and Truth are good things, it's establishing facts and truth that seems to be so difficult these days.

(or maybe always that way)

&amp;#x200B;

The beauty of truth is you don't need any appeal to authority or anything else for that matter to disprove a statement.

If I said Termites cause more co2 than Humans I'd be making a claim

I am not doing this btw.

I don't know if there are any established facts on termites and their co2 contributions.

I am in no doubt that conjecture is everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I think what people are saying is there is natural carbon cycle co2 and then the bit humans add to the mix and this addition is the cause of climate change. 

&amp;#x200B;

it has been shown in a link that we can see the rate of human addition, through ice core analysis, and calculations of the amount of fossil fuels we have added over the past 300 years or so.

and also that the overall system cannot  act as a buffer from the Human additions.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer?

do humans decide to reduce carbon emissions at all costs? 

and try and remove as much co2 from the atmosphere as possible? or learn to adapt to the changes coming.

I have no agenda personally.

will the earth or Human race require an austere period of low carbon emission to enable a future for generations to come? and go down in history as a mythological saviour step in the human story?

1) ""what are the facts?"" No one has actually done a complete termite survey, you can tell how much CO2 and ch4 comes from a terminate, in a lab. But not how many there are.. nor how varied so it's all conjecture. That's the fact, all the rest is conjecture. 

Funny story/fact Jerry Mahlman who is dead now but was the head of NOAA's Geophysicalfluiddynamicslab (the folks who make the GCMs aka climate models)  he told me you can use science to argue any agenda. 

So it's easy to say maybe termites are ""causing more CO2 than humans"" but that's specious. Termites have been here way longer than us by millions of years-- eating wood and waster and farting out CH4 and CO2 they're part of the Carbon cycle.

"ep82er4",2,"&gt;So any paper that has ""global warming"" will be counted every time it is cited, patents and court judgements that refer to it will also be included.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. The number of citations does not contribute to the total of indexed results. I can make very specific searches that show fewer indexed results than there are citations of the first result. For example there are only two results for this [search](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C50&amp;q=%22Climate+change+1995.+Impacts%2C+adaptations+and+mitigation+of+climate+change%3A+scientific-technical+analyses%22&amp;btnG=) but the first result is cited over 1000 times. But anyway, I can remove the inclusion of patents and citations and there are still ~2.5 millions results for [""climate change""](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1%2C50&amp;as_vis=1&amp;q=%22climate+change%22&amp;btnG=). 

&gt;If you remove the quotes then every article in its database that has the word ""change"" gets counted.

That is not how it works. If I search the word [change](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C50&amp;q=change&amp;btnG=) there are more results (~7.9 million) than there are for [climate change](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C50&amp;q=climate+change&amp;btnG=)(~3.5 million). Similarly there are more results for the term [climate](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C50&amp;q=climate&amp;btnG=) (~4.1 million). The reason I included it without the quotes is because there likely exists papers that discuss climate change or global warming without explicitly using the exact phrases.


&gt;examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming.

I think I am missing your point here. I don't see a contradiction.

&gt;I guess you and I have differing standards when we ask for evidence.

This seems needlessly hostile, but I suppose it's accurate. I do think a google scholar search is a reasonable proxy for an order of magnitude estimate and apparently you do not. It's not a particularly bold claim and it's not particularly critical to the argument. The paper you cite is essentially pointing out the same idea: many more papers say AWG is happening than say that it isn't.

Yes, I agree. It's important to note that the greatest potential effect of aerosols is in their indirect effect on cloud cover, which is untenably uncertain (the primary reason for those 'inbuilt assumptions').  This thread basically concerns ideas like Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, if I'm not mistaking, and climate sensitivity continues to represent disagreement among climatologists.  In fact, in addition to the spread of diverse projections, we still have estimates coming to the same conclusions via completely separate explanations, due primarily to cloud cover and its relationship with the oceans.

As far as we know, I can continue to claim that the climate is more sensitive than the average climatologist expects, due to the influence of oceans and cloud cover (particularly low cloud cover), and if anyone wants to disprove me (solving this disagreement) they will have to fund a nice handful of satellites to continuously monitor the oceans for cloud cover, over decades.  I continue to expect, for example, that as the 'warm' phase of the PDO rolls around in \~2035, we will already have been surprised by the severity of these changes, due to our uncertainty, and thus far science has always panned-out this possibility, as far as I have seen.","climate_science",2019-05-28 18:10:48,"bt7t5r","Veridiculity",0,1,0,TRUE,2017-11-05 21:27:20,30,0,511,1339,1880,21,"I know there is a lag in the heating just like it takes time for your body to warm up after you put a blanket on, but how much heating would happen this century from the carbon dioxide that has already been released?

"ep5ukt1",4,"&gt;Including papers on ""climate control"" or air conditioning. 

Ok, excluding control returns 800k results.  Not quite a million, but still a lot.  To be fair, I did say ""*hundreds of thousands* if not millions"".  It was an estimate.  The exact number does not really matter for the point I was making, which is that in the scheme of things, 40 papers is not that much.  Even if it turns out to only be 4,000 papers total that have been written on climate change (which is clearly an absurdly low estimate, but using that number to illustrate the point), that's only 1% of all papers that allegedly refute the theory of anthopogenic climate change.  All of this ignoring the fact that none of the papers cited actually do that.  

&gt;But I see you are the type who makes claims first, then scrambles to force validation later rather than thinks about what they are saying. 

I see you are the type who engages in pedantic debates, rather than analyzing the actual substance of the argument being made.

&gt;That is irrelevant. Your claim was that there were 40 papers vs ""millions""

It's highly relevant, even despite the exceedingly small number of papers that are cited here, since it completely negates the argument being made if none of the studies are even making the claims that are being asserted.

&gt;Here is what you originally said. 

&gt;Using the examples you provided, for the one about greenland being no warmer than it was a century ago,

&gt;And here is your following comment. 

&gt;It shows that very recently, in the 90's there was a high degree of warming, greater than there had been in the last century.

&gt;These contradict each other.

I don't see how these contradict each other.  The first quote is my intepretation of what was being asserted by the OP, and the second quote is my intepretation of the paper.  I should hope they are not the same argument, since I am intending to refute the argument being made, and it would be nonsensical to make the very same argument I am attempting to refute.

&gt;And I am not sure they have much to do with the main focus of the Mikkelsen, Grinsted, Ditlevsen paper which is mostly about sea ice balance. 

&gt;The supplementary material seems to be creating input data for a model. I am really not following what you and the opening post are getting from this. 

&gt;The authors do have this

&gt;Observed fluctuations in Greenland temperature Surface temperature anomalies were obtained from (KNMI). We use the “Twentieth Century Reanalysis V2c” from the years 1851 to 2011 in a box spanning 68◦N to 80◦N and 25◦W to 60◦W.

Yes, this is also an argument that I made, that the study was not even intended to be used for the purpose of measuring temperature, but rather to  create a model of greenland ice based on temperature.  I was simply highlighting that even if you were to use for the purpose that the link the OP posted had used it for, it would still not show what they are claiming.

We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming.** Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors' self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.

Global-scale 21st-century glacier mass change projections from six published global glacier models are systematically compared as part of the Glacier Model Intercomparison Project. In total 214 projections of annual glacier mass and area forced by 25 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emission scenarios and aggregated into 19 glacier regions are considered. Global mass loss of all glaciers (outside the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets) by 2100 relative to 2015 averaged over all model runs varies from 18 ± 7% (RCP2.6) to 36 ± 11% (RCP8.5) corresponding to 94 ± 25 and 200 ± 44 mm sea-level equivalent (SLE), respectively. Regional relative mass changes by 2100 correlate linearly with relative area changes. For RCP8.5 three models project global rates of mass loss (multi-GCM means) of &gt;3 mm SLE per year towards the end of the century. Projections vary considerably between regions, and also among the glacier models. Global glacier mass changes per degree global air temperature rise tend to increase with more pronounced warming indicating that mass-balance sensitivities to temperature change are not constant. Differences in glacier mass projections among the models are attributed to differences in model physics, calibration and downscaling procedures, initial ice volumes and varying ensembles of forcing GCMs.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-28 00:54:27,"bttpbh","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"A new review of glacier research data paints a picture of a future planet with a lot less ice and a lot more water.

**Abstract**

Periodic changes in sediment composition are usually ascribed to insolation forcing controlled by Earth’s orbital parameters. During the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum at 97–91 Myr ago (Ma), a 37–50-kyr-long cycle that is generally believed to reflect obliquity forcing dominates the sediment record. Here, we use a numerical ocean model to show that a cycle of this length can be generated by marine biogeochemical processes without applying orbital forcing. According to our model, the restricted proto-North Atlantic and Tethys basins were poorly ventilated and oscillated between iron-rich and sulfidic (euxinic) states. The Panthalassa Basin was fertilized by dissolved iron originating from the proto-North Atlantic. Hence, it was less oxygenated while the proto-North Atlantic was in an iron-rich state and better oxygenated during euxinic periods in the proto-North Atlantic. This redox see-saw was strong enough to create significant changes in atmospheric pCO₂. We conclude that most of the variability in the mid-Cretaceous ocean–atmosphere system can be ascribed to the internal redox see-saw and its response to external orbital forcing.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-28 00:37:04,"bttiy2","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"An ocean redox seesaw, rather than orbital forcing, can explain climate oscillations during the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum",0.81,3,0,2019-05-28 00:33:33,2019-05-28
"eoz2nii",2,"The aerosols and precursors that are causing dimming are largely offset in their negative radiative forcing (cooling) by the warming effect of black carbon (as shown in that diagram).

The negative radiative forcing from the increased shielding by clouds is somewhere between 0.06 and 1.33 watts per meter squared. As I understand it the higher figure is dependent on estimates of low aerosol cooling the in preindustrial, that is strongly challenged at the moment. 

It is an area of the biggest uncertainty. But roughly speaking the mid point in that figure is close to the total forcing from methane that will rapidly drop off once human sources are stopped. 

It would likely take a serious model simulation to get a definitive answer and then it would have some inbuilt assumptions. But perhaps a jump of a few tenths of a degree followed by a bit of a cooling back to near current temperatures as CH4 changes to CO2?

dTs = λ*dF where dTs is the change (delta) in temperature at the surface (Ts)

dTs = (0.5)[5.35ln(415/280)] ∴ dTs = 1.05 °C

"eowv4fq",4,"The following is a formula for Radiative Forcing (not for °C):

dF = 5.35 ln(C/C_0)

Where 'dF' is the radiative forcing in W/m^2 , 'C' is the concentration of atmospheric CO2, and 'C_0' is the reference CO2 concentration. Normally the value of C_0 is chosen at the pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppmv.

Using the formula from above, we can view atmospheric CO2 derived from the RF of each RCP scenario:

RCP 2.6 = 455ppm CO2

RCP 4.5 = 649ppm CO2

RCP 6.0 = 859ppm CO2

RCP 8.5 = 1371ppm CO2

As a check, we can input 455ppm CO2, rearrange the equation, and solve for x as follows: (e^(x/5.35))*280 = 455 and sure enough we get our approximate answer of 2.597 or ~2.6 W/m^2 as noted in the above RCPs. Rather than 455ppm CO2 let's input our current value (415ppm CO2) and solve for x to see what the radiative forcing will yield:

(e^(x/5.35))*280 = 415 

x = 2.105 W/m^2

**Significance**

It has long been observed that the sequence of sedimentary rocks deposited in the past half-billion years often sharply overlies older igneous or metamorphic basement at an erosional surface known as the Great Unconformity. We provide evidence that this unconformity may record rapid erosion during Neoproterozoic “snowball Earth” glaciations. We show that the extent of Phanerozoic sedimentation in shallow continental seas can be accurately reproduced by modeling the accommodation space produced by the proposed glacial erosion, underlining the importance of glaciation as a means for lowering erosional base level. These results provide constraints on the sedimentary and geochemical environment in which the first multicellular animals evolved and diversified in the “Cambrian explosion” following the unconformity.

**Abstract**

The Great Unconformity, a profound gap in Earth’s stratigraphic record often evident below the base of the Cambrian system, has remained among the most enigmatic field observations in Earth science for over a century. While long associated directly or indirectly with the occurrence of the earliest complex animal fossils, a conclusive explanation for the formation and global extent of the Great Unconformity has remained elusive. Here we show that the Great Unconformity is associated with a set of large global oxygen and hafnium isotope excursions in magmatic zircon that suggest a late Neoproterozoic crustal erosion and sediment subduction event of unprecedented scale. These excursions, the Great Unconformity, preservational irregularities in the terrestrial bolide impact record, and the first-order pattern of Phanerozoic sedimentation can together be explained by spatially heterogeneous Neoproterozoic glacial erosion totaling a global average of 3–5 vertical kilometers, along with the subsequent thermal and isostatic consequences of this erosion for global continental freeboard.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-26 07:24:51,"bt55hq","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"Did Global Glaciation Cause the Great Unconformity?

**Abstract**

Permafrost is a key element of the cryosphere and an essential climate variable in the Global Climate Observing System. There is no remote-sensing method available to reliably monitor the permafrost thermal state. To estimate permafrost distribution at a hemispheric scale, we employ an equilibrium state model for the temperature at the top of the permafrost (TTOP model) for the 2000–2016 period, driven by remotely-sensed land surface temperatures, down-scaled ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data, tundra wetness classes and landcover map from the ESA Landcover Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project. Subgrid variability of ground temperatures due to snow and landcover variability is represented in the model using subpixel statistics. The results are validated against borehole measurements and reviewed regionally. The accuracy of the modelled mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the top of the permafrost is ±2 °C when compared to permafrost borehole data. The modelled permafrost area (MAGT &lt;0 °C) covers 13.9 × 106  km^2 (ca. 15% of the exposed land area), which is within the range or slightly below the average of previous estimates. The sum of all pixels having isolated patches, sporadic, discontinuous or continuous permafrost (permafrost probability &gt;0) is around 21 × 106 km^2 (22% of exposed land area), which is approximately 2 × 106  km^2 less than estimated previously. Detailed comparisons at a regional scale show that the model performs well in sparsely vegetated tundra regions and mountains, but is less accurate in densely vegetated boreal spruce and larch forests.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-26 07:17:46,"bt53tt","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"Satellites Yield Insight Into Not So Permanent Permafrost - Research that uses satellite data has resulted in the first global map of permafrost at a spatial resolution of 1 km",1,2,0,2019-05-26 07:16:49,2019-05-26

Atmospheric aerosols are complex mixtures of different chemical species, and individual particles exist in many different shapes and morphologies. Together, these characteristics contribute to the aerosol mixing state. This review provides an overview of measurement techniques to probe aerosol mixing state, discusses how aerosol mixing state is represented in atmospheric models at different scales, and synthesizes our knowledge of aerosol mixing state's impact on climate‐relevant properties, such as cloud condensation and ice nucleating particle concentrations, and aerosol optical properties. We present these findings within a framework that defines aerosol mixing state along with appropriate mixing state metrics to quantify it. Future research directions are identified, with a focus on the need for integrating mixing state measurements and modeling.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-26 00:14:41,"bt1jfg","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"The Diversity and Complexity of Atmospheric Aerosol - The variability in composition of individual aerosol particles and the way in which they mix in the atmosphere is complex and has significant impacts on Earth’s climate.",1,3,0,2019-05-26 00:13:43,2019-05-26

**Abstract**

The early 20th century warming (EW; 1910-1945) and the mid-20th century cooling (MC; 1950-1980) have been linked to both, internal variability of the climate system and changes in external radiative forcing. The degree to which either of the two factors contributed to EW and MC, or both, is still debated. Using a two-box impulse response model, we demonstrate that multidecadal ocean variability was unlikely to be the driver of observed changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST) after 1850 A.D. Instead, virtually all (97-98%) of the global low-frequency variability (&gt; 30 years) can be explained by external forcing. We find similarly high percentages of explained variance for inter-hemispheric and land-ocean temperature evolution. Three key aspects are identified which underpin the conclusion of this new study: inhomogeneous anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER), biases in the instrumental sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, and inadequate representation of the response to varying forcing factors. Once the spatially heterogeneous nature of AER is accounted for, the MC period is reconcilable with external drivers. SST biases and imprecise forcing responses explain the putative disagreement between models and observations during the EW period. As a consequence, Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) is found to be primarily controlled by external forcing too. Future attribution studies should account for these important factors when discriminating between externally-forced and internally generated influences on climate. We argue that AMV must not be used as a regressor and suggest a revised AMV index instead (North Atlantic Variability Index; NAVI). Our associated best estimate for the transient climate response (TCR) is 1.57 K (±0.70 at the 5-95% confidence level).","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-24 05:13:17,"bscymj","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,12,NA,"Study shows that our knowledge of the climate system can explain the major 20th century temperature changes without much contribution from natural ups and downs, contrary to uninformed claims that global warming is “just a cycle.”",0.8,12,0,2019-05-24 05:12:28,2019-05-24

**Abstract**

We outline a new and improved uncertainty analysis for the Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature product version 4 (GISTEMP v4). Historical spatial variations in surface temperature anomalies are derived from historical weather station data and ocean data from ships, buoys and other sensors. Uncertainties arise from measurement uncertainty, changes in spatial coverage of the station record, and systematic biases due to technology shifts and land cover changes. Previously published uncertainty estimates for GISTEMP included only the effect of incomplete station coverage. Here, we update this term using currently available spatial distributions of source data, state‐of‐the‐art reanalyses and incorporate independently derived estimates for ocean data processing, station homogenization and other structural biases. The resulting 95% uncertainties are near 0.05° C in the global annual mean for the last 50 years, and increase going back further in time reaching 0.15° C in 1880. In addition, we quantify the benefits and inherent uncertainty due to the GISTEMP interpolation and averaging method. We use the total uncertainties to estimate the probability for each record year in the GISTEMP to actually be the true record year (to that date), and conclude with 86% likelihood that 2016 was indeed the hottest year of the instrumental period (so far).","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-23 21:50:08,"bs8s5i","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"A new assessment of NASA’s record of global surface temperatures reveal that the annual values are likely accurate to within 0.05 °C in recent decades, and 0.15 °C at the beginning of the nearly 140-year record.",0.75,2,0,2019-05-23 21:49:23,2019-05-23

**Abstract**

The recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer relies on the continued decline in the atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting gases such as chlorofluorocarbons1. The atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), the second-most abundant chlorofluorocarbon, has declined substantially since the mid-1990s. A recently reported slowdown in the decline of the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 after 2012, however, suggests that global emissions have increased. A concurrent increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia contributes to the global emission increase, but the location and magnitude of this regional source are unknown. Here, using high-frequency atmospheric observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, together with global monitoring data and atmospheric chemical transport model simulations, we investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia. We show that emissions from eastern mainland China are 7.0 ± 3.0 (±1 standard deviation) gigagrams per year higher in 2014–2017 than in 2008–2012, and that the increase in emissions arises primarily around the northeastern provinces of Shandong and Hebei. This increase accounts for a substantial fraction (at least 40 to 60 per cent) of the global rise in CFC-11 emissions. We find no evidence for a significant increase in CFC-11 emissions from any other eastern Asian countries or other regions of the world where there are available data for the detection of regional emissions. The attribution of any remaining fraction of the global CFC-11 emission rise to other regions is limited by the sparsity of long-term measurements of sufficient frequency near potentially emissive regions. Several considerations suggest that the increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern mainland China is likely to be the result of new production and use, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global chlorofluorocarbon production by 2010.

**Abstract**

The Montreal Protocol was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by enabling reductions in the abundance of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere. The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s. However, CFC-11 still contributes one-quarter of all chlorine reaching the stratosphere, and a timely recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer depends on a sustained decline in CFC-11 concentrations. Here we show that the rate of decline of atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations observed at remote measurement sites was constant from 2002 to 2012, and then slowed by about 50 per cent after 2012. The observed slowdown in the decline of CFC-11 concentration was concurrent with a 50 per cent increase in the mean concentration difference observed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and also with the emergence of strong correlations at the Mauna Loa Observatory between concentrations of CFC-11 and other chemicals associated with anthropogenic emissions. A simple model analysis of our findings suggests an increase in CFC-11 emissions of 13 ± 5 gigagrams per year (25 ± 13 per cent) since 2012, despite reported production being close to zero since 2006. Our three-dimensional model simulations confirm the increase in CFC-11 emissions, but indicate that this increase may have been as much as 50 per cent smaller as a result of changes in stratospheric processes or dynamics. The increase in emission of CFC-11 appears unrelated to past production; this suggests unreported new production, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global CFC production by 2010.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-23 03:37:04,"bryc5i","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,9,NA,"How scientists unraveled the mystery behind the return of a banned greenhouse gas - The apparent spike in CFC-11 production in China underscores the importance of ongoing emissions monitoring—and the limits of our current system.",0.92,9,0,2019-05-23 03:32:27,2019-05-23

**Abstract**

The Marine Isotope Stage 19c (MIS19c) interglaciation is regarded as the best orbital analog to the Holocene. The close of MIS19c (~777,000 years ago) thus serves as a proxy for a contemporary climate system unaffected by humans. Our global climate model simulation driven by orbital parameters and observed greenhouse gas concentrations at the end of MIS19c is 1.3 K colder than the reference pre-industrial climate of the late Holocene (year 1850). Much stronger cooling occurs in the Arctic, where sea ice and year-round snow cover expand considerably. Inferred regions of glaciation develop across northeastern Siberia, northwestern North America, and the Canadian Archipelago. These locations are consistent with evidence from past glacial inceptions and are favored by atmospheric circulation changes that reduce ablation of snow cover and increase accumulation of snowfall. Particularly large buildups of snow depth coincide with presumed glacial nucleation sites, including Baffin Island and the northeast Canadian Archipelago. These findings suggest that present-day climate would be susceptible to glacial inception if greenhouse gas concentrations were as low as they were at the end of MIS 19c.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-23 00:20:06,"brwduc","avogadros_number",0,3,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,18,NA,"Ancient farmers spared us from glaciers but profoundly changed the climate: Millennia ago, land was cleared to plant wheat and maize, potatoes and squash.

"eogzunh",3,"&gt;What fraction of methane results in CO2 as a product?

Afaik basically all of it, but the small amount of methane relative to CO2 means that it's not super duper serious once it's converted; I think methane is only 2-3 ppmv in the atmosphere if I remember correctly.

Absolutely right, I totally agree. I usually push back against discussion of methane removal like this because I hate seeing people treat it as directly exchangeable for huge quantities of CO2 when it's not that simple (as you've seen with that review paper). But the risks of nonlinearity do make it a dangerous player in the climate nonetheless.","climate_science",2019-05-22 23:58:47,"bqz90z","horacetheclown",0,3,0,TRUE,2011-10-16 04:45:40,0,0,27413,61898,89311,28,NA,"Researchers outline vision for profitable climate change solution",0.87,28,0,2019-05-20 18:23:31,2019-05-20
"eog1zhk",3,"Thank you for the article. The sources I had read listed the CO2 atmospheric lifetime at ~100 years which is what I used in my analysis. It appears that it is actually better described by a multiexponential decay that includes a component with a lifetime that is effectively infinite. I suppose the actual time scale for this 'infinite' component is probably determined by the fossilization time scale. 

If I understand the logic of the article they are saying that every additional CO2 leads to a permanent increase in the global equilibrium temperature and that GHGs with finite lifetimes have only transient increases in equilibrium temperature. They are basically saying that time scale matters in your analysis. That seems pretty straightforward and unobjectionable to me. I don't think it completely changes my view on the importance of methane removal though because the time scales where its cumulative impact becomes less relevant than carbon is not insignificant and the risk of some unexpected catastrophic nonlinear effect shouldn't be ignored.  After reading a good chunk of the paper though (including the section on 'buying time'), I agree with their conclusion that methane abatement can't come at the cost of CO2 abatement.

I do have a follow up question though. From my understanding, the dominant source of natural methane removal in the atmosphere converts it to CO2 anyway so the argument seems kind of moot with respect to methane in the first place.

____

**Significance**

Future sea level rise (SLR) poses serious threats to the viability of coastal communities, but continues to be challenging to project using deterministic modeling approaches. Nonetheless, adaptation strategies urgently require quantification of future SLR uncertainties, particularly upper-end estimates. Structured expert judgement (SEJ) has proved a valuable approach for similar problems. Our findings, using SEJ, produce probability distributions with long upper tails that are influenced by interdependencies between processes and ice sheets. We find that a global total SLR exceeding 2 m by 2100 lies within the 90% uncertainty bounds for a high emission scenario. This is more than twice the upper value put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the Fifth Assessment Report.

**Abstract**

Despite considerable advances in process understanding, numerical modeling, and the observational record of ice sheet contributions to global mean sea-level rise (SLR) since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, severe limitations remain in the predictive capability of ice sheet models. As a consequence, the potential contributions of ice sheets remain the largest source of uncertainty in projecting future SLR. Here, we report the findings of a structured expert judgement study, using unique techniques for modeling correlations between inter- and intra-ice sheet processes and their tail dependences. We find that since the AR5, expert uncertainty has grown, in particular because of uncertain ice dynamic effects. For a +2 °C temperature scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement, we obtain a median estimate of a 26 cm SLR contribution by 2100, with a 95th percentile value of 81 cm. For a +5 °C temperature scenario more consistent with unchecked emissions growth, the corresponding values are 51 and 178 cm, respectively. Inclusion of thermal expansion and glacier contributions results in a global total SLR estimate that exceeds 2 m at the 95th percentile. Our findings support the use of scenarios of 21st century global total SLR exceeding 2 m for planning purposes. Beyond 2100, uncertainty and projected SLR increase rapidly. The 95th percentile ice sheet contribution by 2200, for the +5 °C scenario, is 7.5 m as a result of instabilities coming into play in both West and East Antarctica. Introducing process correlations and tail dependences increases estimates by roughly 15%.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-21 20:24:57,"brfdqi","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"New research finds global total Sea Level Rise (SLR) exceeding 2 m by 2100 lies within the 90% uncertainty bounds for a high emission scenario.

"eocmykc",8,"If you have the ppmv numbers (which are extremely easy to find; started at 280 ppmv, now we're at 415), you can easily just convert that directly to kg. 

The Earth's atmospheric pressure is about 100,000 Pa --&gt; 100,000 Newtons per m^2. 

You can get the mass of the atmosphere in a 1 m^2 column by dividing that number by g, the gravitational acceleration, which we'll take to be 10 m/s^2. So, 10^5 Pa/10 m/s^2 = 10^4 kg/m^2 of air. 

The average molar mass of the atmosphere is about 29 g/mol, so the number of moles of air (1 mole = 6.022x10^23 molecules) in an atmospheric column with a cross section of 1 m^2  is 10^4 kg/m^2 / (29x10^-3 kg/mol)  = ~3.4x10^5 moles/m^2.

280 ppmv stands for 280 parts per million by volume. Since the atmosphere behaves like an ideal gas, every mole of gas, no matter its identity, takes up the same volume at a given temperature and pressure. So, this is the same thing as saying that out of every million moles in the atmosphere, 280 of them used to be CO2. Now it's 415 for every million. 

So, to get the change in the number of moles of CO2 over a meter^2 of surface, we take (415 mole CO2/10^6 mole air - 280 mole CO2/10^6 mole air)*3.4x10^5 moles of air / m^2 = 46 moles CO2 per meter^2 = ~50 moles CO2 per meter^2 (rounding is fine here, this isn't a precise calculation).  

To get the change in mass of CO2 per m^2 since pre-industrial times, we multiply that number by CO2's molar mass, which is 44 x10^-3 kg/mole: 50 moles/m^2 * 44x10^-3 kg/mole = 2.2 kg CO2 / m^2.

Now to get the total mass of CO2 we've added to the atmosphere, we just multiply that number by the surface area of the earth: 2.2 kg/m^2 * (4pi*(6.371 x10^6 m)^2) = ~10^15 kg CO2 added to the atmosphere. That's a trillion metric tons added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. 

Often the ""safe level"" of CO2 is quoted as 350 ppmv, so you can use these numbers to figure out how many metric tons of CO2 we'd need to remove for ""safety."" Looks like it's roughly half a trillion metric tons. A metric shit-ton, you might say

"eocbh9u",4,"The longer lifetime is extremely important for these things; CO2 is essentially permanent (millennia anyway), whereas methane stays in the atmosphere for only 20 years or so. If we stopped emitting both right now, methane would cease to be a problem within a few years, whereas CO2 would only come out of the sky with massive carbon capture. I didn't express this point well. This is why ""CO2 equivalent"" numbers are not a good way to represent the relative merits of different greenhouse gases--if we put resources into combatting a temporary problem like methane, we're taking resources away from combating the effectively permanent problem of CO2

So I'm seriously considering changing careers to more directly help combat climate change. I'm somewhat overwhelmed trying to research all the options though. I'd love some help figuring out where I might be most helpful. 

My background: I studied molecular biology at a well respected university, spent a year in academia, in devopmental neurobiology (early nervous system development). I then left and started a social enterprise working in preventative mental health that's doing rather well. It's far from a unicorn, so I'm not loaded, but I've got credible entrepreneur credentials now. I'm not committed to leaving, but it's at the point where I could easily leave and the company would be fine.

Through that, I gained a good understanding of the literature around human behaviour change, albeit from a health and well-being perspective. I'm quite good at public speaking and talking about science (I used to tutor), but not at all experienced in debating.

I'm considering a few paths: 

* Science communication/journalism
* Going back to school for a masters that will set me on a relevant academic path. Biotech seems like a good compromise between potential impact and potential for transferable skills, but I'm very open to other options. Including more policy/behaviour change focused work. 
* Looking for a job with a promising climate start up that could use my help

Also open to left-field suggestions! Still very early in this process.","Which are the most promising and/or most understaffed avenues for combating climate change? Where might someone (me) focus their career to have the most impact?",0.92,18,0,2019-05-13 21:42:41,2019-05-13

It is generally accepted that animal heartbeat and lifespan are often inversely correlated, however, the relationship between productivity and longevity has not yet been described for trees growing under industrial and pre-industrial climates. Using 1768 annually resolved and absolutely dated ring width measurement series from living and dead conifers that grew in undisturbed, high-elevation sites in the Spanish Pyrenees and the Russian Altai over the past 2000 years, we test the hypothesis of grow fast—die young. We find maximum tree ages are significantly correlated with slow juvenile growth rates. We conclude, the interdependence between higher stem productivity, faster tree turnover, and shorter carbon residence time, reduces the capacity of forest ecosystems to store carbon under a climate warming-induced stimulation of tree growth at policy-relevant timescales.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-16 19:25:31,"bpgvlh","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,6,NA,"Amount of carbon stored in forests reduced as climate warms - Accelerated tree growth caused by a warming climate does not necessarily translate into enhanced carbon storage, an international study suggests.",0.76,6,0,2019-05-16 19:24:26,2019-05-16

____

**Abstract**



The Laki eruption in Iceland, which began in June 1783, was followed by many of the typical climate responses to volcanic eruptions: suppressed precipitation and drought, crop failure, and surface cooling. In contrast to the observed cooling in 1784–1786, the summer of 1783 was anomalously warm in Western Europe, with July temperatures reaching more than 3 K above the mean. However, the winter of 1783–1784 in Europe was as cold as 3 K below the mean. While climate models generally reproduce the surface cooling and decreased rainfall associated with volcanic eruptions, model studies have failed to reproduce the extreme warming in western Europe that followed the Laki eruption. As a result of the inability to reproduce the anomalous warming, the question remains as to whether this phenomenon was a response to the eruption, or merely an example of internal climate variability. Using the Community Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, we investigate the “Laki haze” and its effect on Northern Hemisphere climate in the 12 months following the eruption onset. We find that the warm summer of 1783 was a result of atmospheric blocking over Northern Europe, that in our model cannot be attributed to the eruption. In addition, the extremely cold winter of 1783–1784 was aided by an increased likelihood of an El Niño after the eruption. Understanding the causes of these anomalies is important not only for historical purposes, but also for understanding and predicting possible climate responses to future high‐latitude volcanic eruptions.

Key Points

- The July 1783 heatwave in Western Europe was likely caused by anomalous circulation, and not caused by the Laki eruption.

- Africa and Asia faced large reductions in precipitation after the Laki eruption, which caused widespread drought and famine.

- The Laki eruption increased the likelihood of an El Niño in the subsequent boreal winter.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-16 19:21:44,"bpgthp","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,4,NA,"An enormous volcanic eruption on Iceland in 1783-84 did not cause an extreme summer heat wave in Europe.

____

**Abstract**



Fluctuations in Antarctic Ice Sheet elevation and mass occur over a variety of timescales, owing to changes in snowfall and ice flow. Here, we disentangle these signals by combining 25 years of satellite radar altimeter observations and a regional climate model. From these measurements, patterns of change that are strongly associated with glaciological events emerge. While the majority of the ice sheet has remained stable, 24% of West Antarctica is now in a state of dynamical imbalance. Thinning of the Pine Island and Thwaites glacier basins reaches 122 m in places, and their rates of ice loss are now five times greater than at the start of our survey. By partitioning elevation changes into areas of snow and ice variability, we estimate that East and West Antarctica have contributed ‐1.1±0.4 and +5.7±0.8 mm to global sea level between 1992 and 2017.

Key Points

- We combine satellite radar altimetry and a regional climate model to separate changes in Antarctic elevation into snow and ice contributions
  
- Between 1992 and 2017, ice thinning has grown in extent to include 24% of West Antarctica, and reaches 122 metres in places

"ennapvf",7,"Sure. 

Aerosols (which can be formed from certain activities like burning stuff or waves breaking) interact with clouds in the atmosphere. Clouds are formed when aerosol act as kind of the glue to water vapor to condensate on (cloud condensation nuclei CCN). When we release more aerosol into the air than the atmosphere has in its natural state, that affects the cloud because it increases the number of CCN and how bright/long lived the cloud is. This effect is most prominent in low, warm clouds which are the most susceptible to changes in CCN. However, the amount aerosol affect the cloud is also moderated by the cloud state itself and the meteorology around the cloud. Rosenfeld has separated clouds in this study by the stability of the boundary layer (lower tropospheric stability LTS) and by the amount of water they contain (liquid water path LWP) to see how clouds in certain stabilities/with certain LWPs react to aerosol. They found unsurprisingly that some clouds are extremely susceptible while others are not. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are a number of environmental parameters that aren't accounted for in this study that can also affect how a cloud reacts to aerosol, such as how dry the atmosphere at certain heights. Also, even if the clouds are extremely susceptible to aerosol as Rosenfeld is saying, this doesn't mean that global warming is at a greater rate than we know. It means that the amount of warming is still highly uncertain, that if warming is being mitigated it may be by cloud feedbacks, and most importantly, that the error, uncertainty, and/or regional variances may explain the rate of warming more than the global average trends Rosenfeld suggests.","climate_science",2019-05-15 18:13:30,"bopsn2","rosealyd",0,7,0,TRUE,2014-12-01 01:14:26,111,0,1140,11193,12444,65,NA,"We need to rethink everything we know about global warming: New calculations show scientists have grossly underestimated the effects of air pollution",0.93,65,0,2019-05-14 22:51:59,2019-05-14

However when we get to the point where all of that carbon is at risk of being released into the atmosphere the planet would already have warmed past any point of return.

Also that carbon is mostly as dead plant material and not straight up methane. When the permafrost melts it will start degrading into CO2 and CH4 due to microbial activity. 

In addition to that we have have large amounts of methane trapped in something called methane clathrates but most of those are so deep in sediments in the bottoms of the continental shelves that they aren't threatened by melting any time soon.

e: just to make it clear, SOME amounts of that 1300-1500pgs of carbon is already ""leaking"" into the atmosphere and the amount will keep increasing but we are talking about some gigatons or at most tens of gigatons during the next ~200 years or so.

So I'm seriously considering changing careers to more directly help combat climate change. I'm somewhat overwhelmed trying to research all the options though. I'd love some help figuring out where I might be most helpful. 

My background: I studied molecular biology at a well respected university, spent a year in academia, in devopmental neurobiology (early nervous system development). I then left and started a social enterprise working in preventative mental health that's doing rather well. It's far from a unicorn, so I'm not loaded, but I've got credible entrepreneur credentials now. I'm not committed to leaving, but it's at the point where I could easily leave and the company would be fine.

Through that, I gained a good understanding of the literature around human behaviour change, albeit from a health and well-being perspective. I'm quite good at public speaking and talking about science (I used to tutor), but not at all experienced in debating.

I'm considering a few paths: 

* Science communication/journalism
* Going back to school for a masters that will set me on a relevant academic path. Biotech seems like a good compromise between potential impact and potential for transferable skills, but I'm very open to other options. Including more policy/behaviour change focused work. 
* Looking for a job with a promising climate start up that could use my help

"emyy79m",6,"I've had an indoor aquaponics lab running via waterfall for years and an outdoor garden as well.  It's just a ""small"" 4 foot tall prototype but between this and my outdoor porch garden I no longer need to buy many herbs to handle myself and my family as an herbalist.

It does indeed scale but instead of building one massive system I've taken to building multiple smaller, independent, towers. It runs off a toilet flush of water a week and my(rather large) goldfish go through a bucket of food every two years. 

I haven't tested it, because I love my fish too much to further experiment on them, but rain water should work in the system and, since it uses less electricity than my old light fixtures, it could easily be taken off grid entirely.

Now all that said you have to understand that it's more about finding what will grow than what you want. That said I use mine as a perpetual apothecary so it worked out wonderfully.

I very much doubt beans and potatoes will ever survive long however everything from kale to chamomile seems to freak right out in a very good way.

Use flat beds for plants that die out(kale, basil) and vertical ones for plants that seem to happily live forever (mints, watercress, chives, chamomile?)

Protein rich staples(beans, potatoes), and plants that prefer it dry(Rosemary, white sage), will need to go outside but if you mix an indoor tower with some outdoor plants you'll quickly end up a tiny self contained colony.

I don't post my work around Reddit but if you'd like to see what doing this actually looks like pm me and I'll send you links to my projects. I'm in an apartment and don't have every plant I plan to use but most people I share my work with are equal parts confused by what appears to be sorcery and impressed.

tl:dr understand what grows well and what doesn't and mix an indoor tower or two with a backyard garden and you'll end up your own herb shop and whole foods in a few years time.

:edit: 

and yes your impressions about this type of work's benefits to the environment are quite correct. A single person coupling an aquaponic system with an organic outdoor garden can offset hundreds, possibly thousands, of ignorant people.

:Update:

Taking your systems off grid, and eating only what you could grow with an aquaponic system and organic gardening would reduce CO2 by 8.1 metric tons per person per year. For contrast a single person driving around for an entire year only creates 4.6 metric tons.

Of the supposed environmental benefits I can list elimination of supply chain &amp; middlemen, some carbon absorption by plants, no pesticide, fertilizer, herbicide, antibiotics, etc... in use (isolated system, fully organic.)

On the food-scarsity contingency side, I can list homegrown food in at least 2 major food-groups, security from both environmental extremes and hungry neighbours (will be inside the house), and hopefully ability to scale-up the operation as needed.

**Abstract**

The oil and gas (O&amp;G) sector represents a large source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. However, estimates of O&amp;G emissions rely upon bottom-up approaches, and are rarely evaluated through atmospheric measurements. Here, we use aircraft measurements over the Canadian oil sands (OS) to derive the first top-down, measurement-based determination of the their annual CO2 emissions and intensities. The results indicate that CO2 emission intensities for OS facilities are 13–123% larger than those estimated using publically available data. This leads to 64% higher annual GHG emissions from surface mining operations, and 30% higher overall OS GHG emissions (17 Mt) compared to that reported by industry, despite emissions reporting which uses the most up to date and recommended bottom-up approaches. Given the similarity in bottom-up reporting methods across the entire O&amp;G sector, these results suggest that O&amp;G CO2 emissions inventory data may be more uncertain than previously considered.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-04 01:27:17,"bkg0ib","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"CO2-sniffing plane finds oilsands emissions higher than industry reported - Environment Canada researchers air samples tell a different story than industry calculations",1,10,0,2019-05-04 01:26:39,2019-05-04

____

**Plain Language Summary**

The World Heritage convention aims at protecting the Earth's outmost assets and commits humanity to transmit them to future generations. However, many World Heritage sites are affected by anthropogenic climate change. Here, we present the first study on the glaciers located within the natural World Heritage sites. We inventoried 19,000 World Heritage glaciers and projected their mass changes over the 21st century. The results emphasize that major glacier decline will occur in these iconic sites in future decades. Nevertheless, ice loss magnitude will vary by a factor of 2 according to CO2 emission scenarios and thus human activities. This study points out how the conservation of World Heritage glaciers could serve as a leverage and a target to tackle the unprecedented issue of climate change. Glaciers are more than disappearing passive climatic indicators. They are key components of planetary ecosystems that influence global climate and sea level, as well as water fluxes, human activities, or biodiversity at the regional scale. The conservation of these iconic endangered features could thus mobilize global‐scale conservation and climate mitigation benefits. In this context, we show how drastic reduction of emissions will rapidly curb melt rates and safeguard a large glacier volume on the long term.

**Abstract**

Since 1972, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Convention aims to identify and protect sites of Outstanding Universal Value for future generations. However, growing impacts of climate change are of the utmost concern for the integrity of many sites. Here, we inventory the glaciers present in natural World Heritage sites for the first time. We found 19,000 glaciers in 46 sites located all over the world. We analyze their recent evolution, current state, and project their mass change over the 21st century. Our results are based on a comprehensive review of the literature as well as a state‐of‐the‐art glaciological model for computing glacier responses up to 2100. Illustrating the strong influence of CO2 emission scenarios and human actions on future ice loss magnitude, we project the wastage of 33% to 60% of the 2017 cumulative ice volume of 12,000 km^3 of World Heritage glaciers by 2100. Furthermore, we expect complete glacier extinction in 8 to 21 of the investigated World Heritage sites until the end of the century, depending on the climate scenario. We suggest that World Heritage glaciers should be considered as analogs to endangered umbrella, keystone, and flagship species, whose conservation would secure wider environmental and social benefits at global scale.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-03 03:25:07,"bk3v8i","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"Almost half of World Heritage sites could lose their glaciers by 2100",1,2,0,2019-05-03 03:24:41,2019-05-03

**Abstract**

Although anthropogenic climate change is expected to have caused large shifts in temperature and rainfall, the detection of human influence on global drought has been complicated by large internal variability and the brevity of observational records. Here we address these challenges using reconstructions of the Palmer drought severity index obtained with data from tree rings that span the past millennium. We show that three distinct periods are identifiable in climate models, observations and reconstructions during the twentieth century. In recent decades (1981 to present), the signal of greenhouse gas forcing is present but not yet detectable at high confidence. Observations and reconstructions differ significantly from an expected pattern of greenhouse gas forcing around mid-century (1950–1975), coinciding with a global increase in aerosol forcing. In the first half of the century (1900–1949), however, a signal of greenhouse-gas-forced change is robustly detectable. Multiple observational datasets and reconstructions using data from tree rings confirm that human activities were probably affecting the worldwide risk of droughts as early as the beginning of the twentieth century.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-05-03 03:23:53,"bk3uml","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"Human-generated greenhouse gases and atmospheric particles were affecting global drought risk as far back as the early 20th century, according to a study from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS)",1,10,0,2019-05-03 03:22:32,2019-05-03

"elud4kv",3,"/r/skeptic is a bit of a mixed bag, and I spent about 3 years as a nearly daily contributor there.  It's not a ""science"" sub, but on its face it's primarily aimed at the art of debunking nonsense.  UFOs, bigfoot, 9/11 Truth, etc.  Below the surface it tackles the arguments of cohesive movements behind ""anti-GMO"", ""anti-vaxx"", ""climate denial"", etc.  It occasionally goes full meta on the nature of skepticism itself, including random epistemological inquiries into the nature of knowledge and evidence.  It's ostensibly based on the concept of *scientific skepticism*, in that all beliefs must be supported by evidence and open to change when contrary evidence is provided, but its hands-off moderation style facilitates the seedy underbelly of Reddit conspiracy-sphere.  Because they're never reprimanded, much less de-platformed, pseudoskeptical contrarians like to frequent /r/skeptic to push whatever anti-science narrative it is they want to push.  Mainly because they know /r/skeptic has lots of users and is a good place to a) trigger liberals, b) win contrarian allies, or c) troll for the hell of it.  It's better for the committed trolls than /r/conspiracy because it's not so virulently insane and echo chamberish.  There is no shortage of arguments that can be started on /r/skeptic, so people go there to argue, because everyone there loves it.  Trolls are inevitably downvoted to hell because /r/skeptic has an undeniable left-lean, but they're never banned, so they stay for shits and giggles and to feel morally superior to users they believe are fake ""skeptics"".  What they *actually* want is to embrace cynical, partisan contrarianism, and they feel like if they push long enough they'll get to convince the hardcore ""skeptics"" that they're *actually* being ""unskeptical"".

At first glance /r/skeptic is a great idea, but with all great ideas comes great responsibility, and the moderation team is so profoundly wedded to the libertarian ideal of an unfettered free marketplace of ideas and so terrified of being accused of partisan censorship that they lay out a red carpet for the worst trolls of Reddit to get their rocks off however they see fit.  ""Rules"" there are little more than un-enforced guidelines.  It's no-holds-barred shitfighting day in and day out.  I stopped participating there about 2 years ago when the mod team expanded with an additional 2 hands-off, wet noodle users who did absolutely nothing to stem the flow of unmitigated bullshit.

climate_control is the alt account of one of the elder /r/climateskeptics mods (many people think it's kokey) that's used almost exclusively on /r/skeptic.  He trolls for months on end until his karma gets close to zero, at which point he spends a few weeks on /r/climateskeptics to beef it back up so he can return unhindered by comment timers or automod filters.  As far as I can tell he's the only one who never got bored and left.  Only two /r/climateskeptics users (that I know of) have ever been banned from /r/skeptic, and that's for using sockpuppet accounts.  The rest lose interest eventually and drift away.  But climate_control is still there, still active, and still a petulant little shit.

5. The story Peña repeatedly trots out about researchers in Antarctica supposedly admitting that global warming is fake?  Notice how he never gives actual names?  No actual humans.  Just a story about something he supposedly heard while on vacation.  No PhD scientist has ever come out to corroborate his account.  Not a single expert who works in Antarctica or anywhere else on the planet.  Funny, huh?  Wouldn't it be easy for him to name drop so we could check behind him to get the full story?  I think it would, and I think there's a reason he doesn't.

**Summary**

Forest ecosystem methane (CH₄) research has focused on soils, but trees are also important sources and sinks in forest CH₄ budgets. Living and dead trees transport and emit CH₄ produced in soils; living trees and dead wood emit CH₄ produced inside trees by microorganisms; and trees produce CH₄ through an abiotic photochemical process. Here, we review the state of the science on the production, consumption, transport, and emission of CH₄ by living and dead trees, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of these processes across hydrologic gradients inclusive of wetland and upland ecosystems. Emerging research demonstrates that tree CH₄ emissions can significantly increase the source strength of wetland forests, and modestly decrease the sink strength of upland forests. Scaling from stem or leaf measurements to trees or forests is limited by knowledge of the mechanisms by which trees transport soil‐produced CH₄, microbial processes produce and oxidize CH₄ inside trees, a lack of mechanistic models, the diffuse nature of forest CH₄ fluxes, complex overlap between sources and sinks, and extreme variation across individuals. Understanding the complex processes that regulate CH₄ source–sink dynamics in trees and forests requires cross‐disciplinary research and new conceptual models that transcend the traditional binary classification of wetland vs upland forest.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-04-20 05:40:54,"bf8zv5","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"There are more reasons than ever to conserve forests, but the surprising role of trees as a methane source adds a complication.",1,11,0,2019-04-20 05:40:06,2019-04-20

**Plain Language Summary**

The rise in atmospheric methane (CH₄), which began in 2007, accelerated in the past 4 years. The growth has been worldwide, especially in the tropics and northern midlatitudes. With the rise has come a shift in the carbon isotope ratio of the methane. The causes of the rise are not fully understood, and may include increased emissions and perhaps a decline in the destruction of methane in the air. Methane's increase since 2007 was not expected in future greenhouse gas scenarios compliant with the targets of the Paris Agreement, and if the increase continues at the same rates it may become very difficult to meet the Paris goals. There is now urgent need to reduce methane emissions, especially from the fossil fuel industry.


**Abstract**

Atmospheric methane grew very rapidly in 2014 (12.7 ± 0.5 ppb/year), 2015 (10.1 ± 0.7 ppb/year), 2016 (7.0 ± 0.7 ppb/year), and 2017 (7.7 ± 0.7 ppb/year), at rates not observed since the 1980s. The increase in the methane burden began in 2007, with the mean global mole fraction in remote surface background air rising from about 1,775 ppb in 2006 to 1,850 ppb in 2017. Simultaneously the ^(13)C/^(12)C isotopic ratio (expressed as δ^(13)C_CH₄) has shifted, has shifted, now trending negative for more than a decade. The causes of methane's recent mole fraction increase are therefore either a change in the relative proportions (and totals) of emissions from biogenic and thermogenic and pyrogenic sources, especially in the tropics and subtropics, or a decline in the atmospheric sink of methane, or both. Unfortunately, with limited measurement data sets, it is not currently possible to be more definitive. The climate warming impact of the observed methane increase over the past decade, if continued at &gt;5 ppb/year in the coming decades, is sufficient to challenge the Paris Agreement, which requires sharp cuts in the atmospheric methane burden. However, anthropogenic methane emissions are relatively very large and thus offer attractive targets for rapid reduction, which are essential if the Paris Agreement aims are to be attained.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-04-19 16:22:56,"bf11lu","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,15,NA,"Rising Methane Emissions Could Derail the Paris Agreement - A new study looks for the source of a spike in the potent greenhouse gas methane.",0.95,15,0,2019-04-19 16:22:24,2019-04-19

**Significance**

Climate models are foundational to formulations of climate policy and must successfully reproduce key features of the climate system. The temporal spectrum of observed global surface temperature is one such critical benchmark. This spectrum is known to obey scaling laws connecting astronomical forcings, from orbital to annual scales. We provide evidence that the current hierarchy of climate models is capable of reproducing the increase in variance in global-mean temperature at low frequencies. We suggest that successful climate predictions at decadal-to-centennial horizons hinge critically on the accuracy of initial and boundary conditions, particularly for the deep ocean state.

**Abstract**

Climate records exhibit scaling behavior with large exponents, resulting in larger fluctuations at longer timescales. It is unclear whether climate models are capable of simulating these fluctuations, which draws into question their ability to simulate such variability in the coming decades and centuries. Using the latest simulations and data syntheses, we find agreement for spectra derived from observations and models on timescales ranging from interannual to multimillennial. Our results confirm the existence of a scaling break between orbital and annual peaks, occurring around millennial periodicities. That both simple and comprehensive ocean–atmosphere models can reproduce these features suggests that long-range persistence is a consequence of the oceanic integration of both gradual and abrupt climate forcings. This result implies that Holocene low-frequency variability is partly a consequence of the climate system’s integrated memory of orbital forcing. We conclude that climate models appear to contain the essential physics to correctly simulate the spectral continuum of global-mean temperature; however, regional discrepancies remain unresolved. A critical element of successfully simulating suborbital climate variability involves, we hypothesize, initial conditions of the deep ocean state that are consistent with observations of the recent past.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-04-16 02:15:21,"bdoica","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"It turns out that climate models do, indeed, correctly simulate temperature variability across timescales, rather well.",1,10,0,2019-04-16 02:13:35,2019-04-16

**Abstract**

Eastern Beringia is one of the few Western Arctic regions where full Holocene climate reconstructions are possible. However, most full Holocene reconstructions in Eastern Beringia are based either on pollen or midges, which show conflicting early Holocene summer temperature histories. This discrepancy precludes understanding the factors that drove past (and potentially future) climate change and calls for independent proxies to advance the debate. We present a ~13.6 ka summer temperature reconstruction in central Yukon, part of Eastern Beringia, using precipitation isotopes in syngenetic permafrost. The reconstruction shows that early Holocene summers were consistently warmer than the Holocene mean, as supported by midges, and a thermal maximum at ~7.6–6.6 ka BP. This maximum was followed by a ~6 ka cooling, and later abruptly reversed by industrial-era warming leading to a modern climate that is unprecedented in the Holocene context and exceeds the Holocene thermal maximum by +1.7 ± 0.7 °C.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-04-11 01:13:49,"bbu29m","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"New research techniques reveal recent warming in the central Yukon region has surpassed the warmest temperatures experienced in the previous 13,600 years, a finding that could have important implications in the context of current global warming trends.",1,3,0,2019-04-11 01:12:32,2019-04-11

**Abstract**

Key observational indicators of climate change in the Arctic, most spanning a 47 year period (1971–2017) demonstrate fundamental changes among nine key elements of the Arctic system. We find that, coherent with increasing air temperature, there is an intensification of the hydrological cycle, evident from increases in humidity, precipitation, river discharge, glacier equilibrium line altitude and land ice wastage. Downward trends continue in sea ice thickness (and extent) and spring snow cover extent and duration, while near-surface permafrost continues to warm. Several of the climate indicators exhibit a significant statistical correlation with air temperature or precipitation, reinforcing the notion that increasing air temperatures and precipitation are drivers of major changes in various components of the Arctic system. To progress beyond a presentation of the Arctic physical climate changes, we find a correspondence between air temperature and biophysical indicators such as tundra biomass and identify numerous biophysical disruptions with cascading effects throughout the trophic levels. These include: increased delivery of organic matter and nutrients to Arctic near‐coastal zones; condensed flowering and pollination plant species periods; timing mismatch between plant flowering and pollinators; increased plant vulnerability to insect disturbance; increased shrub biomass; increased ignition of wildfires; increased growing season CO2 uptake, with counterbalancing increases in shoulder season and winter CO2 emissions; increased carbon cycling, regulated by local hydrology and permafrost thaw; conversion between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; and shifting animal distribution and demographics.

Me and my SO are in the process of making a game set in a post-climate change world with the intent of guiding the player through the responsible development and use of technology to re-industrialize a dying society in a way which is mindful of, if not beneficial to, the environment.

We are crafting the base game play and scene aspects now, and are looking for resources to help us generate a quasi-realistic environment that will become the player's sandbox. To this end, we're interested in having an as-accurate-as-possible science-bassed depiction of post-climate change biodiversity &amp; abundance (at the level of taxa), climate, weather events, etc. For instance, at the game's start, we are assuming that the landscape is quite arid, human populations are sparse and clustered along coast lines with scarce water primarily coming from rudimentary desalintors, and taxa are mostly flies, birds (which seem to suffer the least impact from CC in general) and jellyfish (which from what I understand thrive in an acidified ocean). 

Here's a vague, non-exhaustive, list of things we are interested in (keep in mind that game-play elements will be a caricature of actual effects which would take centuries if not longer IRL):

* A picture of earth after 200-300 years of unchecked climate change, specifically in North America. What is the climate, how frequent are extreme weather events and related natural disasters, etc.
* The general effects of human activities such as farming and community expansion on surrounding ecologies at the per-taxa level if possible. As an exaggerated game-play element, after improving the local region's biodiversity by replanting forests, reintroducing native species, and improving farming conditions, how is the user punished for careless resource exploitation for profit?
* How atmospheric CO2 affects plant growth and farming for the purpose of caricature (e.g. deforestation and carbon use increase local CO2 -- survivable crops then develop more foliage, but not more nutrition, at the expense of high nitrogen consumption and increased water requirements)
* Loss of native plant species due to climate driven invasion, effective management strategies for invasive plants.
* Microbial biodiversity changes + effects up the food chain
* Climate driven effects on viral and bacterial epidemics in mammals, crops



Unfortunately, neither of us are experts in climate science and are unfamiliar with the major predictions of the accepted literature. We would like any references that might help to inform us, even if they are technical. I am a condensed matter physics Ph.D with some knowledge of mathematical ecology and evolutionary dynamics and he is a Biophysics Ph.D. with experience in development and population genetics with an emphasis on mathematics and computation, so between us we should be able to dissect technical reviews. We also have pay-wall access to the standard journals.

If anyone has a go-to list that would acquaint us with the major points, or favorite forecasting papers, we would be super excited about it. Also if anyone is willing to let us spam them questions occasionally in exchange for a mention in our game, or a character/item or something named after you, that would be awesome too!

&gt;The global atmospheric level of methane (CH4), the second most important greenhouse gas, is currently increasing by ∼10 million tons per year. Microbial oxidation in unsaturated soils is the only known biological process that removes CH4 from the atmosphere, but so far, bacteria that can grow on atmospheric CH4 have eluded all cultivation efforts. In this study, we have isolated a pure culture of a bacterium, strain MG08 that grows on air at atmospheric concentrations of CH4 [1.86 parts per million volume (p.p.m.v.)]. This organism, named Methylocapsa gorgona, is globally distributed in soils and closely related to uncultured members of the upland soil cluster α. CH4oxidation experiments and 13C-single cell isotope analyses demonstrated that it oxidizes atmospheric CH4 aerobically and assimilates carbon from both CH4 and CO2. Its estimated specific affinity for CH4 (a0s) is the highest for any cultivated methanotroph. However, growth on ambient air was also confirmed for Methylocapsa acidiphila and Methylocapsa aurea, close relatives with a lower specific affinity for CH4, suggesting that the ability to utilize atmospheric CH4 for growth is more widespread than previously believed. The closed genome of M. gorgonaMG08 encodes a single particulate methane monooxygenase, the serine cycle for assimilation of carbon from CH4 and CO2, and CO2 fixation via the recently postulated reductive glycine pathway. It also fixes dinitrogen and expresses the genes for a high-affinity hydrogenase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, suggesting that atmospheric CH4 oxidizers harvest additional energy from oxidation of the atmospheric trace gases carbon monoxide (0.2 p.p.m.v.) and hydrogen (0.5 p.p.m.v.).","climate_science",2019-04-08 22:20:22,"bazzct","Thoroughly_away8761",0,1,0,TRUE,2018-12-25 19:00:27,0,0,6589,7660,14249,7,NA,"Widespread soil bacterium that oxidizes atmospheric methane.

**Abstract**

Variations in Earth’s orbit pace the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary, but the mechanisms that transform regional and seasonal variations in solar insolation into glacial-interglacial cycles are still elusive. Here, we present transient simulations of coevolution of climate, ice sheets, and carbon cycle over the past 3 million years. We show that a gradual lowering of atmospheric CO₂ and regolith removal are essential to reproduce the evolution of climate variability over the Quaternary. The long-term CO₂ decrease leads to the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and an increase in the amplitude of glacial-interglacial variations, while the combined effect of CO₂ decline and regolith removal controls the timing of the transition from a 41,000- to 100,000-year world. Our results suggest that the current CO₂ concentration is unprecedented over the past 3 million years and that global temperature never exceeded the preindustrial value by more than 2°C during the Quaternary.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-04-04 19:44:03,"b9hdlu","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,6,NA,"Mid-Pleistocene transition in glacial cycles (41,000 to 100,000) explained by declining CO2 and regolith removal",1,6,0,2019-04-04 19:43:23,2019-04-04

Here we use airborne altimetry and satellite imagery to show that since 2016 Jakobshavn has been re-advancing, slowing and thickening. We link these changes to concurrent cooling of ocean waters in Disko Bay that spill over into Ilulissat Icefjord. Ocean temperatures in the bay’s upper 250 m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland. Longer time series of ocean temperature, subglacial discharge and glacier variability strongly suggest that ocean-induced melting at the front has continued to influence glacier dynamics after the disintegration of its floating tongue in 2003. We conclude that projections of Jakobshavn’s future contribution to sea-level rise that are based on glacier geometry are insufficient, and that accounting for external forcing is indispensable.

**Abstract**

In climates with strongly seasonal rainfall, speleothem-based paleoclimate reconstructions are often thought to reflect wet season conditions, assuming a bias toward the season with greater water supply. This is particularly true in monsoon regions, where speleothem records are interpreted to document monsoon strength changes on multiple timescales. Dry season infiltration variability and rainfall seasonality are not typically considered in these reconstructions, even though cave ventilation could bias speleothem growth toward the cooler season. To investigate the influence of dry season infiltration on speleothem geochemistry, we combine a modern, sub-seasonally resolved trace element record from Mawmluh Cave in Northeast India with forward modeling experiments. We find that variations in the amplitude of seasonal signals in speleothem Mg/Ca, which reflects prior carbonate precipitation, are more sensitive to dry season rather than monsoon season infiltration. This sensitivity may be enhanced by dry season cave ventilation. The Mawmluh speleothem Mg/Ca record is consistent with increased dry season rainfall during the 1976–1998 warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation relative to 1964–2013. Our work demonstrates the importance of considering non-monsoon season rainfall when interpreting speleothem paleoclimate records and suggests that trace elements could provide insight into periods of enhanced dry season infiltration in monsoonal climates.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-03-26 05:30:02,"b5lsr2","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"Stalagmite holds key to predicting droughts, floods for India",1,2,0,2019-03-26 05:28:57,2019-03-26

**Abstract**

A recent compilation of methane plumes detected offshore Washington State includes 1,772 individual bubble streams issuing from 491 discrete vent sites. The majority of these plume sites form a narrow 10‐km‐wide band located shallower than 250‐m water depth, with most sites located near the 175‐m‐deep continental shelf break that tracks the head scarps of large submarine canyons. Archive multichannel seismic profiles over the Cascadia shelf and uppermost margin that were co‐located within a few hundred meters with active emission sites show that methane bubble streams arise from listric/normal faults and triangular‐shaped regions of disturbed seismic reflectors that intersect the seafloor and extend several kilometers into the subsurface. Geological processes were evaluated for producing the narrow emission site depths including nonuniform distribution of methane within the Cascadia accretionary sediment wedge and horizontal transfer of groundwater from onshore subaerial sources. A model of enhanced sediment permeability arising from a contrasting response between the inner and outer portions of the accretionary wedge deformation during a megathrust earthquake cycle appears the most likely mechanism. This faulting is generated during extension of the overriding plate during megathrust earthquake cycles, with semicontinuous permeability enhancement of the fluid pathways from excitation by contemporary incident seismic waves.

**Plain Language Summary**

Recognizing individual components of the global carbon cycle is critical to understand both past and present future climates. The sediments that accumulate on continental margins are an underappreciated part of this cycle, containing 40% of the oceanic reservoir of free carbon. Methane plumes issuing from the seafloor are an unquantified leakage of carbon from this giant reservoir. The current inventory of methane plumes on the northern Cascadia margin now approaches 500 emission sites, or an average of one a bubble emission site every 500 m. The majority of these methane emission sites are grouped within a north‐south band that follows the continental shelf edge and uppermost margin. The geological process for producing such a narrow band of emissions appears related to the megathrust earthquakes that occur episodically on the Cascadia Subduction Zone that underlies the Washington coast. During these earthquakes, the Juan de Fuca plate is thrust eastward beneath the overlying North American plate. The overlying plate that includes the Washington continental shelf extends rapidly westward during the fault motion. This rapid westward extension of the overlying plate produces faults and diapirs beneath the outer continental shelf, which become pathways for the methane fluid and gas from the margin sediments.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-03-25 21:39:31,"b5gtjm","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,17,NA,"A new large-scale analysis of methane emissions along Washington’s coast finds more than 1,700 bubble plumes.

___

**Significance**

Using 21st century climate model projections we show that for many crop-producing regions, average precipitation will change by more than the long-term natural variability, even under a low-emission scenario. However, emissions compatible with the Paris Agreement can significantly reduce cropped land affected. We identify the regions where adaptation measures are most needed.

**Abstract**

A warming climate will affect regional precipitation and hence food supply. However, only a few regions around the world are currently undergoing precipitation changes that can be attributed to climate change. Knowing when such changes are projected to emerge outside natural variability—the time of emergence (TOE)—is critical for taking effective adaptation measures. Using ensemble climate projections, we determine the TOE of regional precipitation changes globally and in particular for the growing areas of four major crops. We find relatively early (&lt;2040) emergence of precipitation trends for all four crops. Reduced (increased) precipitation trends encompass 1–14% (3–31%) of global production of maize, wheat, rice, and soybean. Comparing results for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 clearly shows that emissions compatible with the Paris Agreement result in far less cropped land experiencing novel climates. However, the existence of a TOE, even under the lowest emission scenario, and a small probability for early emergence emphasize the urgent need for adaptation measures. We also show how both the urgency of adaptation and the extent of mitigation vary geographically.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-03-14 03:29:10,"b0vfn9","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,3,NA,"Even if humans radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term, important crop-growing regions of the world can expect changes to rainfall patterns by 2040.

**Abstract**

We tested how sediment trapping by hydroelectric dams affects tropical estuaries by comparing two dammed and two undammed rivers on Mexico’s Pacific coast. We found that dams demonstrably affected the stability and productivity of the estuaries. The two rivers dammed for hydroelectricity had a rapid coastal recession (between 7.9 and 21.5 ha year−1) in what should otherwise be an accretional coastline. The economic consequences of this dam-induced coastal erosion include loss of habitat for fisheries, loss of coastal protection, release of carbon sequestered in coastal sediments, loss of biodiversity, and the decline of estuarine livelihoods. We estimate that the cost of the environmental damages a dam can cause in the lower part of basin almost doubles the purported benefits of emission reductions from hydroelectric generation.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-03-14 02:52:55,"b0v2v6","avogadros_number",0,3,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"In a blow to the image of hydropower as a source of green energy, scientists have found that damming of tropical rivers not only damage downstream ecosystems, but can indirectly dump more carbon dioxide into the air than the electricity they generate saves in fossil fuel emissions.",0.86,10,0,2019-03-14 02:50:37,2019-03-14

**Abstract**

Disentangling the relative importance of climate change abatement policies from the human–Earth system (HES) uncertainties that determine their performance is challenging because the two are inexorably linked, and the nature of this linkage is dynamic, interactive and metric specific. Here, we demonstrate an approach to quantify the individual and joint roles that diverse HES uncertainties and our choices in abatement policy play in determining future climate and economic conditions, as simulated by an improved version of the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy. Despite wide-ranging HES uncertainties, the growth rate of global abatement (a societal choice) is the primary driver of long-term warming. It is not a question of whether we can limit warming but whether we choose to do so. Our results elucidate important long-term HES dynamics that are often masked by common time-aggregated metrics. Aggressive near-term abatement will be very costly and do little to impact near-term warming. Conversely, the warming that will be experienced by future generations will mostly be driven by earlier abatement actions. We quantify probabilistic abatement pathways to tolerable climate/economic outcomes, conditional on the climate sensitivity to the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Even under optimistic assumptions about the climate sensitivity, pathways to a tolerable climate/economic future are rapidly narrowing.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-03-12 19:41:54,"b0c2pa","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,5,NA,"A new comprehensive study of climate change has painted over 5 million pictures of humanity's potential future, and few foretell an Earth that has not severely warmed.

"eid0nts",1,"If you had read my previous comments, you would know that I don’t deny climate change and that I acknowledge the global increase in temperature. However, like many climate scientists, I question the extent to which human are attributable for rising temperature. In fact, the co-founder of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore and I share the same view on climate change. Yes, the Earth is warming, but how far are humans responsible for it? As previously outlined, there are a great many factors which influence temperature. One of the major groups of factors which change climate (as a NASA scientist would know) are astronomical variables. I am all for science, but scientifically this is by far the most important. Tilt of the earth, sun output, distance between earth and sun + other geological factors have to be accounted for. It would be (ironically) unscientific to point to one single cause of climate change because that would be inaccurate. Therefore, to a large extent, climate change is out of our hands. Of course, efforts can be made to stop what we can (ideas discussed down below) but ultimately we can’t control the course of nature and anyone who says otherwise is being unrealistic.

Despite having been provided with several links, I found no evidence to support your claim that the Earth would become uninhabitable. The Earth has been previously far warmer than today and man has survived through that. An increase in temperature would not send mankind into oblivion. As far as I know, even pro climate change scientists do not credit this idea. 

Here is what I think can be done to reduce our role in climate change. As I said in a previous comment, the US is reliant energy, 72% of which is generated using fossil fuels. Therefore, removing fossil fuels would significantly harm the economy and the country (and trade partners with the US) would crumble. *However efforts can be made to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. For example, if we regulate our electricity consumption, naturally, if less electricity is needed, less is going to be produced which means less harmful fuels get burnt. This idea of conservation is far more effective than eradicating coal/oil.*

We don't even know how much more of the CO2 (if any) will accumulate in the oceans instead of the atmosphere, and thus contribute less to warming (though more to ocean acidification, and so on).

Temperature increases also lag behind CO2 concentration increases, afaik more than a decade.

Edit: Just to be sure to mention this: 2C warming by the end of the century assumes low climate-sensitivity (comparatively little warming for each additional ppm CO2). Most reports of the recent decades seem to indicate that we're at the higher end of the sensitivity-spectrum of the models, and we could very well already be locked in for 2C warming or more by 2050, even without further emissions.

"eibx8i3",13,"There's an analogy that global warming is like a minefield- the farther we go, the more mines we hit, and the greater the chance that something will go terribly wrong. 

Beyond 2C, a lot more people will die around the world, mostly in poorer countries, from increased disease transmission and food and water insecurity. Though not just poorer countries- we will likely see reprises of the European heatwave of 2003 that killed over 30,000. It means we will likely lose the world's tropical coral reefs. It means increased frequency of extreme weather events. It means more and longer droughts, with hundreds of millions more people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves. Grain yields will decrease in the hottest regions and crops will become less nutritious. Glaciers that feed some of the worlds major river systems will be under increased pressure. Ecosystems will be increasingly stressed and extinctions accelerate. Sea level rise will accelerate, with greater risk of triggering instabilities in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. 

Things start to get really nasty above 2C. Its possible the Amazon rainforest collapses and reverts to savannah, the Indian monsoon is disrupted, desertification of the American heartland, etc. Above 4C global warming has been described as ""beyond the limits of adaptation"" and ""incompatible with organized global society.""

Currently we will fail to stop at 2C without heroic action. If nations make good on their Paris agreement promises we may see 3.5C.

**Abstract**

Solar geoengineering (SG) has the potential to restore average surface temperatures by increasing planetary albedo, but this could reduce precipitation. Thus, although SG might reduce globally aggregated risks, it may increase climate risks for some regions. Here, using the high-resolution forecast-oriented low ocean resolution (HiFLOR) model—which resolves tropical cyclones and has an improved representation of present-day precipitation extremes—alongside 12 models from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), we analyse the fraction of locations that see their local climate change exacerbated or moderated by SG. Rather than restoring temperatures, we assume that SG is applied to halve the warming produced by doubling CO₂ (half-SG). In HiFLOR, half-SG offsets most of the CO₂-induced increase of simulated tropical cyclone intensity. Moreover, neither temperature, water availability, extreme temperature nor extreme precipitation are exacerbated under half-SG when averaged over any Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extremes (SREX) region. Indeed, for both extreme precipitation and water availability, less than 0.4% of the ice-free land surface sees exacerbation. Thus, while concerns about the inequality of solar geoengineering impacts are appropriate, the quantitative extent of inequality may be overstated.

"eialvvu",4,"""We must push with renewed vigor and talent research in the use of nonfossil fuels. The power of the atom, the heat of the sun and the steam stored deep in the Earth, the force of the winds and water must be main sources of energy for our grandchildren, and we can do it."" - Pres. Gerald Ford, 1974

Ten years ago I saw a documentary, ""Houston We Have A Problem"", at the AFI Dallas International Film Festival. Times have changed since then! US production of crude oil bottomed out in 2008, so the oilmen in the film have a fairly apocalyptic view of the future of oil. It would be interesting to see what they're doing now after the 150% increase in US oil production during the Obama years.

Or for example James Hackett of Anadarko Petroleum talks about what fuels are used for electricity production. Checking up on it now, US electricity has gone from 50% to 30% coal, 30% to 20% nuclear, 20% to 32% natural gas, and 9% to 17% renewables (which Hackett at 16:16 doesn't even mention).

When Ford made that quote in 1974, right after the Arab Oil Embargo was ended, Republicans believed energy independence was a number one priority for the US, but a Democratic majority in Congress didn't follow Ford's lead. Because of the Embargo, some things were done, like the 55 mph speed limit and other energy saving measures, but they didn't really get behind a push for renewables.

The Ford quote is at 29:23. There's another good quote at 1:17:54 - ""The Stone Age did not end for the lack of rocks. The Oil Age will not end for the lack of oil.""

"eiakki6",10,"&gt; Of those factors, as you said, human output and influence on the climate is quite small 

This isn't true. Humans are burning about 3.5 cubic miles of oil equivalent per year, putting about 37 billion metric tons of new CO2 into the atmosphere each year. This is enough to increase atmospheric CO2 by about 5 ppm each year, but around half of it is absorbed by the oceans, where it reduces the alkalinity of seawater. That leaves enough to increase CO2 levels by about 2.5ppm, which is in fact the measured increase. This amount of CO2 is about 200 times what volcanoes currently emit.

The main problem with dismissal of global warming because Earth has always gone through changes, is that it ignores the fact that all those changes happen for reasons. Temperature doesn't just go up and down for no reason. 

Before the Carboniferous there was ten times as much CO2 in the atmosphere as now, because that was how the Earth started. Average temperatures were about 15C (~30F) warmer than today. During the Carboniferous, plants removed CO2 from the atmosphere and over time the plants were buried and became coal deposits. CO2 levels came down and average temperatures became close to what they are today.

At the end of the Permian, volcano fields in what is now Siberia sprung up through some of those Carboniferous coal deposits, burning the coal and releasing CO2 into the atmosphere again. This lead to the Permian-Triassic Extinction that killed most animal life on Earth.

What we're doing now is not as extreme as that, but the principle is the same.There was a reason why temperatures rose at the end of the Permian, and it's the same reason why temperatures are rising now. And the same goes for ocean acidification, which is part of what killed off 97% of ocean life during the Permian-Triassic Extinction.

"ei35l7a",5,"I think it’s important to contextualize such predictions with other documents generated at the time, as well as considering the sorts of predictions which were being made.  [The IPCC’s AR1 report, Chapter 6](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapter_06.pdf) was published just a year later in 1990, and the predictions they give for temperature change over the next century are dependent on climate sensitivity figures and emissions scenarios.  Their Business as Usual scenario, for instance, was a 1% per-annum increase in CO2, which is actually very high compared to what has actually been happening, roughly 0.5% per annum.  Even then, their predictions are not extremely dire.  What did happen should be compared to the scenario which best matches reality, not compared to what they suggested could be a worst case *emissions* scenario.  If predictions of doomsday were made back then based on unrealistic projections of the inputs to the model, then that’s hardly a claim against the model.

We didn’t have the types of modeling capabilities back then as we do now, too.  So if certain predictions have changed dramatically with time, it’s fair to view those in light of advancements in computing power and parameterization, first.

What was concerning back then was that there were some important sources of uncertainty: we didn’t have a great idea what climate sensitivity could be, we didn’t know how much we would emit, and we didn’t know how certain gases like CFCs would change (the Montreal Protocol had only just been passed).  Uncertainty about whether the outcome will be disastrous or just bad does not beget surety to stay the course, IMO.  Regardless, what better answers we have now to those questions are still not at all reassuring.  Climate change deniers will point to concern at a time of higher uncertainty as evidence that we should not listen to concern at a time of lower uncertainty.  I don’t think that’s well motivated.","climate_science",2019-03-08 18:42:26,"ayq7k5","richard_sympson",0,5,0,TRUE,2014-05-27 18:48:54,8,0,131,24295,24434,14,NA,"FB friend posted this old article as evidence the UN/scientists aren't being honest/successfully predicting climate change.

"ei34ojo",1,"Great follow up. As I previously stated (then from memory), more than one variable controls the Earth's temperature.


The main variables are the concentration of greenhouse gases, as well as the amount of heat the Earth receives from the sun which is also not constant, but varies more slowly than greenhouse gases.


Since the Ordovician (over 400 million years ago), the amount of heat the Earth has received from the sun has steadily declined. The decline has been VERY slow compared to human time scales and the change is almost non-existent over the last few million years. CO2 varies more quickly even on the 100,000 year timescale and anthropogenic CO2 of course changes on the 100 year and 10 year timescales.


In the Ordovician, with less solar heat, the amount of CO2 required to melt all glaciers was multiple thousands of parts-per-million. They could have tons of CO2 and not be nearly as warm.


Currently, and for the last 100 million years, the amount of CO2 required to melt glaciers is much lower than 400 million years ago, because the Earth is now receiving more heat from the sun.


So we are currently at over 400 ppm CO2 and before the industrial age it was 280 ppm. At the rate we're going we can easily pass 600 ppm or even go to 1000 ppm on human time scales, and the resulting climate would be quite different than any experienced by man and could exceed CO2 values the Earth has experienced for 10's of millions of years.


For time reference, we split from chimps about 5 million years ago and anatomically modern humans might have existed for about 300,000 years.


When you combine this CO2 level, way higher than man has experienced, with our higher solar heat variable, you get a very hot planet. Not the hottest the Earth has ever been but hotter than we've ever seen by a long shot. This comes with coastal flooding, more rainfall, ocean acidification and other effects.


I live in Houston where hurricanes like Hurricane Harvey will likely occur much more often now.


You linked to one article which gets into the details of the carbon cycle and how it might have differed due to chemical weathering processes hundreds of millions of years ago. This stuff is not yet fully explained but it does seem like during the Ordovician, the carbon cycle was quite different (on top of the solar changes) and the correlation between CO2 and temperature was less strong. In any case, the farther back in time you go, the weirder stuff gets and the more different Earth is from today.


We can say with much higher certainty that CO2 has definitely been the primary driver of temperature for at least the last 800,000 years for which we have ice cores. The farther back you go the more you need various isotopes and proxies to infer global temperatures and CO2 values.


Here are some cool links:

Since climate sensitivity is state dependent, that could change their answer somewhat (although I think it would be a small difference since the starting points wouldn't be all that different).

"ei2ge8e",10,"This one has been making the rounds.  Take a look at specific predictions made that would apply to the present day:

&gt;The most conservative scientific estimate that the Earth’s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years, said Brown.

Given that this is in Farhenheit (since it's an American piece from the 80s), it turns out that was correct - [temps rose about 1 degree F (0.6 degrees C) over the following 30 years](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1989/mean:12).

&gt;He said even the most conservative scientists ″already tell us there’s nothing we can do now to stop a ... change″ of about 3 degrees.

This is consistent with what scientists are saying now, too - [the big effort now is to keep temperatures from rising much more than 1.5 degrees C](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-limit-degrees-ipcc-climate-change) (roughly 3 degrees F) by the year 2100, because that amount of warming is basically inevitable.

As they have with the recent ""12 years"" figure, the ""skeptics"" confuse the time frame over which we have to act in order to prevent future warming, versus the time frame over which that warming will occur. It doesn't help that the mass media articles on the topic (both then and now) are often written in a way that it's easy to confuse the two.","climate_science",2019-03-08 13:32:05,"ayq7k5","BelfreyE",0,10,0,TRUE,2014-08-15 11:43:16,408,0,1029,20621,22058,14,NA,"FB friend posted this old article as evidence the UN/scientists aren't being honest/successfully predicting climate change.

The baseline levels they're getting seem to be around A\*10^(-8) to A\*10^(-7) W/m^(2), which is to say, some singles to tens of ***billions*** times less energy than the integrated TSI.

The summary you gave, if it’s an accurate reflection of the video maker’s hypothesis, is flatly wrong, because the integrated [outgoing longwave radiation](https://res.mdpi.com/remotesensing/remotesensing-10-01539/article_deploy/remotesensing-10-01539.pdf?filename=&amp;attachment=1) is still nonetheless approximately 238 W/m^(2), which is fully explained by total solar irradiance: 1361 / 4 \* 0.7 ~ 237.  If there was “a majority” of energy actually coming from CMEs and the solar wind, then this would be a dramatic underestimation, by (as you say) at least half.

Second, the videographer fails to notify the viewer that the radiation increase they’re talking about tends to come in the form of (a) radiation which is already comparatively weak in terms of proportion of energy output from the Sun, so very temporary increases of those amounts need to be moderated by baseline levels; (b) ionizing radiation, meaning the main interaction effect of such radiation is not thermal heating, but the breaking of chemical bonds in the atmosphere or on the surface of the planet, a net endothermic reaction (meaning the energy leftover for thermal heating is substantially less than that); and (c) radiation which gets wrapped up in the upper atmosphere, where we already know that the thermosphere (for instance) gets very hot, and responds dramatically to such events, but doesn’t convectively mix with the lower levels nor efficiently conductively heat those levels.","climate_science",2019-03-08 11:54:55,"ay2563","richard_sympson",0,3,0,TRUE,2014-05-27 18:48:54,8,0,131,24295,24434,13,"I'm almost there with accepting anthropogenic climate change.

"ei10skf",2,"It's an important factor for explaining why CO2 could be so high without creating hothouse Earth, yes.  As Pohl et al. allude to, it's not a satisfactory explanation by itself for how we could transition into a snowball Earth—you need something to change, and while a stable climate in a Faint Sun scenario may have high CO2, you need one of them to change to cause snowball Earth, and the Sun takes far too long compared to the geological history of the Ordovician glaciation.  They say:

&gt; Fainter Sun (Gough, 1981) somewhat reduces this apparent
discrepancy between high CO2 levels and glacial inception
by suggesting that the solar constant was lower in the past.
Nevertheless, it seems insufficient; the best hypotheses today
consider a Late Ordovician drop in CO2 to be the trigger of
glaciation (Brenchley et al., 1994; Kump et al., 1999; Villas
et al., 2002; Lenton et al., 2012).

[This paper, Bahcall et al. 2001](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0010346.pdf), suggests that around when the Ordovician was (some ~ 450 MYA), solar luminosity (energy emitted per unit time) was roughly 4% lower than today (their Table 2).  That translates to some 54 W/m^2 less sunlight at the top of our atmosphere, which is very substantial.  (In terms of radiative forcing, average energy per unit area onto the planet's surface, you divide by 4—because only a quarter of the Earth's surface ever faces the Sun—and multiply by 1 - A, where A is the albedo; so it may be something like 8-11 W/m^(2) radiative forcing.  Contrast this to an estimated 3.7 W/m^(2) radiative forcing change per doubling of CO2.)

Basically, many clouds in the upper atmosphere are mixed phase, meaning they consist of a mixture of supercooled liquid droplets and solid ice particles. As the climate warms, the proportion of water within clouds shifts toward liquid droplets because the ice melts. The liquid droplets are smaller and more reflective, so, as the climate warms, the shift in mixed phase partitioning increases earth's albedo and counteracts some of the greenhouse warming by reflecting away more sunlight. Yay, a negative feedback. Now, the interesting bit of the paper, however, is that most climate models have been greatly over-representing that effect. they basically assumed that the clouds started off with a much larger proportion of ice particles than recent satellite observations indicate, which means that they greatly over-represented this increase in cloud albedo with warming (since in reality, according to observations, there isn't all that much ice to melt in the clouds to make them more reflective), which means they UNDER-represented climate sensitivity to a given amount of CO2 forcing.

Weather forecasts consider current atmospheric conditions to predict what will happen next. The models are an incredibly valuable tool, but we also use satellite, radar, MOS data, weather station data, and information collected from weather balloons to determine what the weather will be like in a few hours, tomorrow, a few days, and next week.  

Climate change, while very real and deeply alarming, isn't necessarily preventing meteorologists from figuring out what the atmosphere is going to do. For example, climate change is causing hurricanes to slow in speed, which is increasing the flooding associated with these storms. A forecaster (as well as models) will still base their prediction off the current trends of the atmosphere and the observed behavior and data collected from that particular storm.

"ehzmc60",1,"Hey OP, as others have explained, the longest ice core records we have go back about 800,000 years, and over that time CO2 ranged from around 170 to 300 ppm.  We’ve now raised CO2 around a third above that range, to over 400 ppm. 

I made some graphs to put the recent increase into the perspective of the ice core data.  I used the [EPICA-C ice core data](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/co2/ice_core_co2.html). Then I combined that with the [Law Dome ice core](https://imgur.com/fYE5WOh) and the [Mauna Loa direct measurements](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html), to get a more complete time series to the present.

[Here are the data for the past 20,000 years](https://imgur.com/qDSPJMZ), covering the increase from the last glacial period up to the current value.  You can see the sudden increase to the current value much better on the right side of the graph, there.

"ehywbq7",5,"The important thing to keep in mind is that the warming effect of CO2 is documented, testable, and as historic as Darwin’s “On The Origin of Species”.  We know that it causes warming by physics.  We further have very substantial pieces of evidence, with for instance the close track of CO2 and temperature in ice cores over the past several hundred thousand years (with CO2 leading temperature changes globally, mind you, despite the appearance of a lag the other way around when only looking at southern cores), or also the cause of the PETM, which prove that CO2 causes global warming.

Peculiarities of certain snowball Earth episodes do not present evidence against physics, they only highlight how there can be more factors at play.  You may have your datasets mixed up a bit, but there have certainly been times when there was high CO2 and extensive sea ice or ice sheets.  The late Ordovician is a good example of where several other factors would be at play.  For instance, the Sun at that time was at a younger stage in its life, and had lower total irradiance.  Also, the continental arrangement was different, and that impacts ocean heat transport poleward, and impacts sensitivity of that transport to other factors.  Some more recent ocean modeling attempts like [Pohl et al. (2014)](https://www.clim-past.net/10/2053/2014/cp-10-2053-2014.pdf) try to investigate the possibility that with that arrangement, there may be a “tipping point” where glaciation starts at a higher CO2 concentration than we may otherwise expect.

Furthermore, the CO2 record during the late Ordovician nonetheless matches our general understanding of causality, namely that when CO2 was drawn down, glaciation followed, and then when CO2 increased following the covering of silicate rocks by ice (preventing erosion by CO2), deglaciation followed.  [Young et al.

"ehyv776",3,"As others have said, there’s a few things here that are almost right.

First, CO2 is one of multiple temperature drivers but it has been the most prominent driver the last few million years.

Second, if you go back in time far enough, there were times of anomalously high CO2 and still had some glaciers. So the fact that the correlation between temperature and CO2 breaks down if you go far enough back, is seen as evidence of multiple climate trends super-imposed on each other.

Third, as others have mentioned I think the time when CO2 was high and there were glaciers was pre-Cretaceous (&gt;100 million years ago) but I’m going from memory here. The Cretaceous certainly had high CO2 but it was warm, as you’d expect.

So even knowing that there are other controls on global temperature the argument for anthropogenic C02 emissions being the dominant driver now is pretty straightforward. The logic can be broken down to 4 ideas:

1. We know C02 has been increasing the last few hundred years.

2. We know temperature has been increasing the last few hundred years, closely mirroring the C02 increase.

3. We know how greenhouse gases can cause temperature rise, thus explaining the very tight correlation between temperature and C02 trends, i.e. we can infer with high confidence that the recent temperature rise is due to C02. It’s probably causation not just correlation because the causal mechanism is well understand (that greenhouse gases warm the atmosphere).

4. We know that the primary source of C02 into the atmosphere the past few hundred years is due to human activity. We released millions of years of carbon captured by organic matter (marine plankton, in the case of oil) and released it in 200 years so that’s VERY fast for the carbon cycle.

To reject anthropogenic climate change, you’d have to take issue with at least one of those 4 points but all 4 points are pretty straightforward and verifiable. We can find some sources if you want details on any of those points.

The interesting conversation to me is what to do about it. I think the case could be made that it’s cheaper to adapt than to try to stop it since we’ll likely blow past the 2 degree Celsius threshold. In any case, it does not make sense to deny it or do nothing but there is a real debate about what is the best path forward once you accept climate change.

Notably, even if you reject anthropogenic climate change it would STILL make sense to proactively adapt to a changing climate and prepare rather than do nothing.","climate_science",2019-03-07 03:07:32,"ay2563","Deckard_88",0,3,0,TRUE,2012-08-25 23:33:58,20,0,4,1294,1318,13,"I'm almost there with accepting anthropogenic climate change.

___

**Abstract**

This study explores the extent to which convective aggregation interacts with sea surface temperature (SST) and affects climate sensitivity. For this purpose, radiative‐convective equilibrium simulations are run with a general circulation model coupled to an ocean mixed layer, and several types of perturbations are imposed to the ocean‐atmosphere system. Convective aggregation turns out to be much more sensitive to temperature in coupled experiments than in prescribed SST experiments. But changes in convective aggregation induced by a doubling of the CO2 concentration are always smaller than changes associated with the transition from a non‐aggregated to an aggregated state. If aggregation changes were acting alone, they would exert a strong negative feedback on global mean surface temperature. However, in a coupled framework, aggregation changes interact with the SST and generate SST gradients that strengthen the positive low‐cloud feedback associated with changes in SST pattern. This overcompensates the negative feedback due to aggregation changes and leads to a larger equilibrium climate sensitivity than in the absence of SST gradients. Although this effect might be model specific, interactions between convective aggregation and the spatial distribution of SST appear crucial to assess the impact of convective aggregation on climate sensitivity.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-03-07 02:27:04,"ay7e1a","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,8,NA,"Improving Estimates of Long-Term Climate Sensitivity - New modeling casts doubt on the suitability of running experiments with fixed sea surface temperatures to understand the effects of cloud aggregation on Earth’s climate.",0.9,8,0,2019-03-07 02:25:51,2019-03-07

___

**Significance**

North Pacific jet stream (NPJ) behavior strongly affects cool-season moisture delivery in California and is an important predictor of summer fire conditions. Reconstructions of the NPJ before modern fire suppression began in the early 20th century identify the relationships between NPJ characteristics and precipitation and fire extremes. After fire suppression, the relationship between the NPJ and precipitation extremes is unchanged, but the NPJ–fire extremes relationship breaks down. Simulations with high CO2 forcing show higher temperatures, reduced snowpack, and drier summers by 2070 to 2100 whether overall precipitation is enhanced or reduced, thereby overriding historical dynamic NPJ precursor conditions and increasing fire potential due to thermodynamic warming. Recent California fires during wet extremes may be early evidence of this change.

**Abstract**

Moisture delivery in California is largely regulated by the strength and position of the North Pacific jet stream (NPJ), winter high-altitude winds that influence regional hydroclimate and forest fire during the following warm season. We use climate model simulations and paleoclimate data to reconstruct winter NPJ characteristics back to 1571 CE to identify the influence of NPJ behavior on moisture and forest fire extremes in California before and during the more recent period of fire suppression. Maximum zonal NPJ velocity is lower and northward shifted and has a larger latitudinal spread during presuppression dry and high-fire extremes. Conversely, maximum zonal NPJ is higher and southward shifted, with narrower latitudinal spread during wet and low-fire extremes. These NPJ, precipitation, and fire associations hold across pre–20th-century socioecological fire regimes, including Native American burning, postcontact disruption and native population decline, and intensification of forest use during the later 19th century. Precipitation extremes and NPJ behavior remain linked in the 20th and 21st centuries, but fire extremes become uncoupled due to fire suppression after 1900. Simulated future conditions in California include more wet-season moisture as rain (and less as snow), a longer fire season, and higher temperatures, leading to drier fire-season conditions independent of 21st-century precipitation changes. Assuming continuation of current fire management practices, thermodynamic warming is expected to override the dynamical influence of the NPJ on climate–fire relationships controlling fire extremes in California. Recent widespread fires in California in association with wet extremes may be early evidence of this change.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-03-05 01:05:12,"axf046","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"A Long View of California’s Climate: Study examines centuries of data to understand climate–wildfire links",1,2,0,2019-03-05 01:04:29,2019-03-05

1) Marine stratocumulus are not a tropical cloud type per say.

The author seems to assume that the location they occur in wouldn't be affected by the change in SST, when if the SST was increasing, the region they would form would shift towards the colder waters. 

2) SST patterns, which drive the formation of mSc and eventual mSc to CU transition, weren't accounted for and remain uncertain. 

3) The mSc to CU transition is affected by more than just the local radiative balance. These clouds have turbulence driven by cloud top cooling, however the break up process is more complex than a decrease in turbulence. 

4) All other effects like aerosol or the water vapor feedback were glossed over. The author assumes that the relative humidity of the entire atmosphere will follow the \~7%/K increase that CC estimates, which has never been proven from observations to be the case. Instead, it is much more likely that individual levels on a regional basis will be more affected by a water vapor feedback, meaning the free atmospheric relative humidity may remain unchanged in subsiding regions above mSc.","climate_science",2019-02-27 16:00:47,"auosiz","rosealyd",0,2,0,TRUE,2014-12-01 01:14:26,111,0,1140,11193,12444,44,NA,"Cloud-resolving climate models suggest major instability in tropical cloud cover at high CO2",0.96,44,0,2019-02-25 18:54:59,2019-02-25

**Abstract**

Negative carbon emission technologies are critical for ensuring a future stable climate. However, the gaseous state of CO2 does render the indefinite storage of this greenhouse gas challenging. Herein, we created a liquid metal electrocatalyst that contains metallic elemental cerium nanoparticles, which facilitates the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to layered solid carbonaceous species, at a low onset potential of −310 mV vs CO2/C. We exploited the formation of a cerium oxide catalyst at the liquid metal/electrolyte interface, which together with cerium nanoparticles, promoted the room temperature reduction of CO2. Due to the inhibition of van der Waals adhesion at the liquid interface, the electrode was remarkably resistant to deactivation via coking caused by solid carbonaceous species. The as-produced solid carbonaceous materials could be utilised for the fabrication of high-performance capacitor electrodes. Overall, this liquid metal enabled electrocatalytic process at room temperature may result in a viable negative emission technology.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-02-27 08:58:50,"avbd7j","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,5,NA,"Climate rewind: Researchers have used liquid metals to turn carbon dioxide back into solid coal, in a world-first breakthrough that could transform our approach to carbon capture and storage.",0.74,5,0,2019-02-27 08:57:26,2019-02-27

**Abstract**



This paper investigates the problem of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of Dynamical Earth System Models and proposes a basis for how such analyses should be performed. We argue that (a) performance metric‐based approaches to parameter GSA are actually identifiability analyses, (b) the use of a performance metric to assess sensitivity unavoidably distorts the information provided by the model about relative parameter importance, and (c) it is a serious conceptual flaw to interpret the results of such an analysis as being consistent and accurate indications of the sensitivity of the model response to parameter perturbations. Further, because such approaches depend on availability of system state/output observational data, the analysis they provide is necessarily incomplete. Here we frame the GSA problem from first principles, using trajectories of the partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to controlling factors as the theoretical basis for sensitivity, and construct a global sensitivity matrix from which statistical indices of total period time‐aggregate parameter importance, and time series of time‐varying parameter importance, can be inferred. We demonstrate this framework using the HBV‐SASK conceptual hydrologic model applied to the Oldman basin in Canada and show that it disagrees with performance metric‐based methods regarding which parameters exert the strongest controls on model behavior. Further, it is highly efficient, requiring less than 1,000 base samples to obtain stable and robust parameter importance assessments for our 10‐parameter example.

**Plain Language Summary**

When developing and using computer‐based models to (a) understand Earth and environmental systems, (b) make predictions, and/or (c) make management or policy decisions, it is very important to know which factors most strongly control the behaviors of the model. Tools to determine this are called sensitivity analysis (SA) methods. This paper shows that the use of model performance metrics to assess sensitivity is based in faulty reasoning. By framing the problem from first principles, a logical approach is developed that provides accurate and cost‐effective assessments of both time‐aggregate and time‐varying parameter importance. Because the approach does not require availability of system output data, it enables a comprehensive assessment and can be applied to historical and predictive conditions, as well as to future scenarios.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-02-25 17:29:47,"aunrjx","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,1,NA,"Reframing Sensitivity Analysis in Earth System Models - According to a new study, the performance metric–based methods currently used to evaluate dynamical model sensitivity are based upon faulty reasoning and need to be reenvisioned.",1,1,0,2019-02-25 17:28:23,2019-02-25

**Abstract**

Stratocumulus clouds cover 20% of the low-latitude oceans and are especially prevalent in the subtropics. They cool the Earth by shading large portions of its surface from sunlight. However, as their dynamical scales are too small to be resolvable in global climate models, predictions of their response to greenhouse warming have remained uncertain. Here we report how stratocumulus decks respond to greenhouse warming in large-eddy simulations that explicitly resolve cloud dynamics in a representative subtropical region. In the simulations, stratocumulus decks become unstable and break up into scattered clouds when CO2 levels rise above 1,200 ppm. In addition to the warming from rising CO2 levels, this instability triggers a surface warming of about 8 K globally and 10 K in the subtropics. Once the stratocumulus decks have broken up, they only re-form once CO2 concentrations drop substantially below the level at which the instability first occurred. Climate transitions that arise from this instability may have contributed importantly to hothouse climates and abrupt climate changes in the geological past. Such transitions to a much warmer climate may also occur in the future if CO2 levels continue to rise.

"eh8l54i",1,"IMO, the solution to a man made problem is a man made solution. It will have to go through geoengineering the earth. Those technologies are still expensive vs traditional oil and gas (100$ for air carbon capture vs 35$ for gas). Personally, I think Direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) is the most promising. Our offsetting should finance these projects. Environmental groups don’t talk about these but they will be necessary as we won’t move away from fossil fuels quickly  enough. The other challenge is ensuring our politicians and industries know about these solutions.

The reason I’m trying to better understand the technical aspects of offsetting is that we’re considering launching a large-scale reduction/offsetting campaign. If we can tell people that every individual going neutral through reduction and offsetting would halt rising greenhouse gasses, that’s a pretty powerful statement. Will it fully solve the problem? No. Will it be possible to get everyone involved? No. But it will be a step in the right direction, make individuals feel less powerless and more likely to act, and help to build momentum.

"eh70q1a",1,"As already mentioned the main problem is systemic corruption in politics and media and that is also the reason why the problem is concentrated in America and other Anglo-American (Murdoch) countries.

There is no coherent counter theory. They do not mind that their arguments refute each other; the only coherence is the claim mainstream science is wrong. Politics cannot be avoided.

What is more a taboo topic is the role of right-wing extremism. In Europe we have far less systemic corruption and the far-right parties are the only ones denying climate change. It makes sense, Greenpeace told them that the poor would suffer most, while in their world view more inequality and more survival of the fittest is a good thing.

Frank Luntz is a conservative political consultant that put out a memo detailing a strategy to improve conservative arguments about the environment by tempering the severity of the issue and furthering the debate. [Here is an article discussing the memo](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/mar/04/usnews.climatechange) and [here is the memo.](https://web.archive.org/web/20040203162027/http://www.ewg.org/briefings/luntzmemo/pdf/LuntzResearch_environment.pdf)  He proposed using ""climate change"" instead of the term ""global warming"" because it sounded less frightening, and to emphasize a lack of consensus in the scientific community.  He also casts doubt on the ability of government to regulate and fund a solution to global warming, while also claiming that the US was doing more to reduce pollution than other nations so we were not to take any blame nor responsibility.  

 [There are differing opinions](https://nigguraths.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/the-story-of-the-frank-luntz-memo/) on the purpose of his memo and subsequently how its message was used and perceived by both political parties, so it's important to read it and gain your own understanding of its content.

**Abstract**

Black carbon (BC) contributes to Arctic climate warming, yet source attributions are inaccurate due to lacking observational constraints and uncertainties in emission inventories. Year-round, isotope-constrained observations reveal strong seasonal variations in BC sources with a consistent and synchronous pattern at all Arctic sites. These sources were dominated by emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the winter and by biomass burning in the summer. The annual mean source of BC to the circum-Arctic was 39 ± 10% from biomass burning. Comparison of transport-model predictions with the observations showed good agreement for BC concentrations, with larger discrepancies for (fossil/biomass burning) sources. The accuracy of simulated BC concentration, but not of origin, points to misallocations of emissions in the emission inventories. The consistency in seasonal source contributions of BC throughout the Arctic provides strong justification for targeted emission reductions to limit the impact of BC on climate warming in the Arctic and beyond.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-02-23 16:15:06,"atwzpg","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"Fossil Fuel Combustion Is the Main Contributor to Black Carbon Around the Arctic, International Study Finds",1,11,0,2019-02-23 16:13:49,2019-02-23

A quarter of our yearly CO2 emissions, it says, are taken up by the terrestrial biospheres. They are talking about possibly some of that not taken up any more in a warming world.

But it is an early study, it could go the other way as they go to more detailed studies. They say that they are now looking at how well their model maps the tropics.

Though they don't mention it, I've also seen articles suggesting that as the Siberian and Canadian permafrost melt - it could lead to more release of methane, but it could also lead to more uptake of CO2, for instance in peatlands studied in northern Canada, then permafrost that melted after forest fires showed a net uptake of carbon due to peat formation, and less CO2 and methane was released than expected. So it is hard to model, and in some cases it can even be carbon negative.

**Abstract**

A major challenge in articulating human dimensions of climate change lies in translating global climate forecasts into impact assessments that are intuitive to the public. Climate-analog mapping involves matching the expected future climate at a location (e.g., a person’s city of residence) with current climate of another, potentially familiar, location - thereby providing a more relatable, place-based assessment of climate change. For 540 North American urban areas, we used climate-analog mapping to identify the location that has a contemporary climate most similar to each urban area’s expected 2080’s climate. We show that climate of most urban areas will shift considerably and become either more akin to contemporary climates hundreds of kilometers away and mainly to the south or will have no modern equivalent. Combined with an interactive web application, we provide an intuitive means of raising public awareness of the implications of climate change for 250 million urban residents.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-02-14 05:37:11,"aqgfik","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,9,NA,"In one generation, the climate experienced in many North American cities is projected to change to that of locations hundreds of miles away—or to a new climate unlike any found in North America today.",1,9,0,2019-02-14 05:35:59,2019-02-14

"egdangf",4,"Here is the plain language summary of the paper the article writes about:

&gt;A previous analysis by Thompson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579) showed substantial differences between satellite‐observed and model‐simulated stratospheric cooling trends since the late 1970s. Here we compare recently revised and extended satellite temperature records with new simulations from 14 chemistry‐climate models. The results show much better agreement in the magnitude of stratospheric cooling over 1979–2005 between models and observations. This cooling was predominantly driven by increasing greenhouse gases and declining stratospheric ozone levels. An extended satellite temperature record and the chemistry‐climate models show weaker global stratospheric cooling over 1998–2016 compared to 1979–1997. This is due to the reduction in ozone‐induced cooling from the slowdown of ozone trends and the onset of ozone recovery since the late 1990s. There are larger differences in the latitudinal structure of past stratospheric temperature trends due to the effects of unforced atmospheric variability. In summary, the results show much better consistency between simulated and satellite‐observed stratospheric temperature trends than was reported by Thompson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579) for the previous versions of the satellite record and last generation of chemistry‐climate models. The improved agreement mainly comes from updates to the satellite records, while the range of simulated trends is comparable to the previous generation of models.

The article is a simple explanation of the new analysis that shows stratospheric temperature trends are in agreement with the climate models. I understand that this has been a somewhat difficult task due to the limited amount of data on the stratosphere as a whole, so it is good to see progress in this area. This is also one of the observational measurements I point to when talking to people who believe climate change science is all models or to people who believe the warming is natural. This is a real effect that is happening; the cooling in the stratosphere is dependent on a large amount of warming in the troposphere due to an increase in greenhouse gases. From the conclusion of the paper:

&gt; CCMI experiments designed to separate the effects of changes in atmospheric ODSs and other long‐lived greenhouse gases indicate that GHGs made a dominant contribution to global stratospheric temperature trends over 1998–2016, while both ODSs (via their effect on ozone) and GHGs made comparable contributions to cooling near 1 hPa over 1979–1997 and ODSs dominated the lower stratospheric cooling trend prior to 1997.
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, chemistry‐climate models forced with observed changes in GHGs and ODSs, and which include other drivers of stratospheric temperature variability (e.g., solar variability), simulate long‐term stratospheric temperature trends since 1979 that are in good quantitative agreement with updated and extended satellite temperature records both globally and in their latitudinal structure. ...","climate_science",2019-02-13 07:41:37,"aq40w7","[deleted]",0,4,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,13,NA,"Satellite Observations Validate Stratosphere Temperature Models",0.94,13,0,2019-02-13 07:23:06,2019-02-13

**Abstract**

Knowledge of the ice thickness distribution of the world’s glaciers is a fundamental prerequisite for a range of studies. Projections of future glacier change, estimates of the available freshwater resources or assessments of potential sea-level rise all need glacier ice thickness to be accurately constrained. Previous estimates of global glacier volumes are mostly based on scaling relations between glacier area and volume, and only one study provides global-scale information on the ice thickness distribution of individual glaciers. Here we use an ensemble of up to five models to provide a consensus estimate for the ice thickness distribution of all the about 215,000 glaciers outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The models use principles of ice flow dynamics to invert for ice thickness from surface characteristics. We find a total volume of 158 ± 41 × 10^(3) km^(3), which is equivalent to 0.32 ± 0.08 m of sea-level change when the fraction of ice located below present-day sea level (roughly 15%) is subtracted. Our results indicate that High Mountain Asia hosts about 27% less glacier ice than previously suggested, and imply that the timing by which the region is expected to lose half of its present-day glacier area has to be moved forward by about one decade.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-02-13 07:07:15,"aq3wc0","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,11,NA,"Researchers have provided a new estimate for the glacier ice volume all around the world, excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

**Abstract**

Tropical cyclones that rapidly intensify are typically associated with the highest forecast errors and cause a disproportionate amount of human and financial losses. Therefore, it is crucial to understand if, and why, there are observed upward trends in tropical cyclone intensification rates. Here, we utilize two observational datasets to calculate 24-hour wind speed changes over the period 1982–2009. We compare the observed trends to natural variability in bias-corrected, high-resolution, global coupled model experiments that accurately simulate the climatological distribution of tropical cyclone intensification. Both observed datasets show significant increases in tropical cyclone intensification rates in the Atlantic basin that are highly unusual compared to model-based estimates of internal climate variations. Our results suggest a detectable increase of Atlantic intensification rates with a positive contribution from anthropogenic forcing and reveal a need for more reliable data before detecting a robust trend at the global scale.

**Abstract**

Ice provides a range of ecosystem services—including fish harvest, cultural traditions, transportation, recreation and regulation of the hydrological cycle—to more than half of the world’s 117 million lakes. One of the earliest observed impacts of climatic warming has been the loss of freshwater ice, with corresponding climatic and ecological consequences. However, while trends in ice cover phenology have been widely documented, a comprehensive large-scale assessment of lake ice loss is absent. Here, using observations from 513 lakes around the Northern Hemisphere, we identify lakes vulnerable to ice-free winters. Our analyses reveal the importance of air temperature, lake depth, elevation and shoreline complexity in governing ice cover. We estimate that 14,800 lakes currently experience intermittent winter ice cover, increasing to 35,300 and 230,400 at 2 and 8 °C, respectively, and impacting up to 394 and 656 million people. Our study illustrates that an extensive loss of lake ice will occur within the next generation, stressing the importance of climate mitigation strategies to preserve ecosystem structure and function, as well as local winter cultural heritage.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-02-07 02:46:42,"anyzp7","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,1,NA,"Climate Change Could Leave Thousands of Lakes Ice-Free",1,1,0,2019-02-07 02:44:59,2019-02-07

"efur7m7",1,"**4.2 kiloyear event**

The 4.2-kiloyear BP aridification event was one of the most severe climatic events of the Holocene epoch. It defines the beginning of the current Meghalayan age in the Holocene epoch.  Starting in about 2200 BC, it probably lasted the entire 22nd century BC. It has been hypothesised to have caused the collapse of the Old Kingdom in Egypt as well as the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia, and the Liangzhu culture in the lower Yangtze River area. The drought may also have initiated the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation, with some of its population moving southeastward to follow the movement of their desired habitat, as well as the migration of Indo-European speaking people into India.

Effectively, we look at a past climates to infer what our future climate may or may not look like and use that as a guide to prepare us for what is likely to come (one of the great advantages humans have above most organisms, is our ability plan far in advance and prepare for the future). This is crucial, because modern society has spent a lot of time building infrastructure that is susceptible to rising sea levels, and melting permafrost to name just a couple. A growing population demands more use of freely available fresh water for such things as agriculture and industry. The social and economical impacts are profound and we must try to mitigate the effects as much as possible.

Some food for thought... Why do so many ancient civilizations have stories about massive floods? (the epic of Gilgamesh, Noah, First Nations, etc.) What contributed to the downfall of so many ancient civilizations around Ancient Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Mesopotamia, and across much of Asia?

Because no one is listening to them, and they have been warning about the consequences for decades.

https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2458/why-a-half-degree-temperature-rise-is-a-big-deal/

But the part I'm looking for is what that 1 degree represents in terms of *total energy*. 

The total heat energy (measured in joules) added to a system the size of the Earth has got to be astronomical!

One really interesting topic in my science classes was the important difference between heat and temperature. For instance, a block of metal and a jar of water might both rise the same degree - but the water takes a LOT more heat energy (joules) to show that difference. And if you take each - a hot metal bar and a jar of hot water - and place them in a room, the room with the water will warm more than the room with the bar. 

Here's a link that goes into it globally:

https://skepticalscience.com/Breaking_News_The_Earth_is_Warming_Still_A_LOT.html

The amount of increased energy discussed - after just a few years - is in the range of ten to the 22nd power - a number with 22 zeros after it. Which is a LOT.

**Summary**

The large-scale Atlantic Ocean circulation moves warm, saline near-surface water from the tropics to far northern latitudes, where it cools, sinks, and returns southward at depth. The fundamental role of this Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) for the past, present, and future climate is regularly assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, including the most recent special report on global warming of 1.5°C (1). However, observations of the AMOC are sparse, and scientific knowledge is mainly based on model simulations. On page 516 of this issue, Lozier et al. (2) estimate the strength of the AMOC from the subpolar North Atlantic based on 21 months of continuous observations from the OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) array.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-02-02 04:39:41,"amat6g","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"A surprising new picture of ocean circulation could have major consequences for climate science - Some experts say the Atlantic Ocean circulation is already slowing down, but we’re just beginning to learn how it really works.",0.92,10,0,2019-02-02 04:38:48,2019-02-02

**Abstract**

Extratropical volcanic eruptions are commonly thought to be less effective at driving large-scale surface cooling than tropical eruptions. However, recent minor extratropical eruptions have produced a measurable climate impact, and proxy records suggest that the most extreme Northern Hemisphere cold period of the Common Era was initiated by an extratropical eruption in 536 ce. Using ice-core-derived volcanic stratospheric sulfur injections and Northern Hemisphere summer temperature reconstructions from tree rings, we show here that in proportion to their estimated stratospheric sulfur injection, extratropical explosive eruptions since 750 ce have produced stronger hemispheric cooling than tropical eruptions. Stratospheric aerosol simulations demonstrate that for eruptions with a sulfur injection magnitude and height equal to that of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, extratropical eruptions produce time-integrated radiative forcing anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics up to 80% greater than tropical eruptions, as decreases in aerosol lifetime are overwhelmed by the enhanced radiative impact associated with the relative confinement of aerosol to a single hemisphere. The model results are consistent with the temperature reconstructions, and elucidate how the radiative forcing produced by extratropical eruptions is strongly dependent on the eruption season and sulfur injection height within the stratosphere.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-31 05:28:43,"alm8c7","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"Extratropical volcanoes influence climate more than assumed - Study shows surprisingly strong cooling after volcanic eruptions in mid and high latitudes",0.67,2,0,2019-01-31 05:27:52,2019-01-31

___

**Abstract**

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is routinely cited as a cost effective tool for climate change mitigation. CCS can directly reduce industrial CO2 emissions and is essential for the retention of CO2 extracted from the atmosphere. To be effective as a climate change mitigation tool, CO2 must be securely retained for 10,000 years (10 ka) with a leakage rate of below 0.01% per year of the total amount of CO2 injected. Migration of CO2 back to the atmosphere via leakage through geological faults is a potential high impact risk to CO2 storage integrity. Here, we calculate for the first time natural leakage rates from a 420 ka paleo-record of CO2 leakage above a naturally occurring, faulted, CO2 reservoir in Arizona, USA. Surface travertine (CaCO3) deposits provide evidence of vertical CO2 leakage linked to known faults. U-Th dating of travertine deposits shows leakage varies along a single fault and that individual seeps have lifespans of up to 200 ka. Whilst the total volumes of CO2 required to form the travertine deposits are high, time-averaged leakage equates to a linear rate of less than 0.01%/yr. Hence, even this natural geological storage site, which would be deemed to be of too high risk to be selected for engineered geologic storage, is adequate to store CO2 for climate mitigation purposes.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-31 05:15:53,"alm4nm","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,1,NA,"Fault lines are no barrier to safe CO2 storage - Carbon dioxide emissions can be captured and securely stored in underground rocks, even if geological faults are present, research has confirmed.",0.66,1,0,2019-01-31 05:14:45,2019-01-31

**Abstract**

Large-volume pyroclastic eruptions are not known from the basalt-dominated British Palaeogene Igneous Province (BPIP), although silicic magmatism is documented from intra-caldera successions in central volcanoes and from small-volume ash-layers in the associated lava fields. Exceptions are the Sgùrr of Eigg (58.7 Ma) and Òigh-sgeir pitchstones in the Inner Hebrides (&gt;30 km apart), which have been conjectured to represent remnants of a single large silicic event. Currently available major element data from these outcrops differ, however, creating a need to test if the two pitchstones are really related. We employ a systematic array of methods ranging from mineralogy to isotope geochemistry and find that samples from the two outcrops display identical mineral textures and compositions, major- and trace elements, and Sr-Nd-Pb-O isotope ratios, supporting that the two outcrops represent a single, formerly extensive, pyroclastic deposit. Available isotope constraints suggest a vent in the Hebridean Terrane and available radiometric ages point to Skye, ~40 km to the North. A reconstructed eruption volume of ≥5km^3 DRE is derived, suggesting a VEI 5 event or larger. We therefore argue, contrary to long-held perception, that large-volume silicic volcanism and its associated climatic effects were likely integral to the BPIP during the opening of the North Atlantic.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-30 21:22:32,"alhnaa","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,9,NA,"Could Past Global Climate Have Been Changed by an Eruption ... in Scotland?",0.92,9,0,2019-01-30 21:21:26,2019-01-30

___

**Abstract**



Methane (CH4) is produced in many natural systems that are vulnerable to change under a warming climate, yet current CH4 budgets, as well as future shifts in CH4 emissions, have high uncertainties. Climate change has the potential to increase CH4 emissions from critical systems such as wetlands, marine and freshwater systems, permafrost, and methane hydrates, through shifts in temperature, hydrology, vegetation, landscape disturbance, and sea level rise. Increased CH4 emissions from these systems would in turn induce further climate change, resulting in a positive climate feedback. Here we synthesize biological, geochemical, and physically focused CH4 climate feedback literature, bringing together the key findings of these disciplines. We discuss environment‐specific feedback processes, including the microbial, physical, and geochemical interlinkages and the timescales on which they operate, and present the current state of knowledge of CH4 climate feedbacks in the immediate and distant future. The important linkages between microbial activity and climate warming are discussed with the aim to better constrain the sensitivity of the CH4 cycle to future climate predictions. We determine that wetlands will form the majority of the CH4 climate feedback up to 2100. Beyond this timescale, CH4 emissions from marine and freshwater systems and permafrost environments could become more important. Significant CH4 emissions to the atmosphere from the dissociation of methane hydrates are not expected in the near future. Our key findings highlight the importance of quantifying whether CH4 consumption can counterbalance CH4 production under future climate scenarios.

**Plain Language Summary**

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, second only to carbon dioxide in its importance to climate change. Methane production in natural environments is controlled by factors that are themselves influenced by climate. Increased methane production can warm the Earth, which can in turn cause methane to be produced at a faster rate ‐ this is called a positive climate feedback. Here we describe the most important natural environments for methane production that have the potential to produce a positive climate feedback. We discuss how these feedbacks may develop in the coming centuries under predicted climate warming using a cross‐disciplinary approach. We emphasize the importance of considering methane dynamics at all scales, especially its production and consumption and the role microorganisms play in both these processes, to our understanding of current and future global methane emissions. Marrying large‐scale geophysical studies with site‐scale biogeochemical and microbial studies will be key to this.

"ef4bt77",3,"&gt;Previous research has shown that when volcanoes located at high latitudes erupt, sulfate aerosols tend to stay in a single hemisphere, whereas when volcanoes located in the tropics erupt, aerosols can be dispersed on a global scale. **Therefore**, to use climate engineering to cool the entire planet, injecting sulfur dioxide into the tropical atmosphere makes sense.

I 100% agree with the part before the **therefore**. Volcanoes at higher latitudes should have a greater effect on the northern hemisphere than the whole globe, and I bet the northern most the volcano the more local the cooling effect and the lesser on global temperatures. The eruption happens above 65N during winter the effect on global temperature is almost 0 (the polar night).

I 100% disagree with the part after the **therefore** for the following reasons:

1. The globe is not warming evenly. [The north hemisphere is warming faster than the south.](https://www.berkeley.edu/news2/2013/04/ITA.jpg). And within the north hemisphere the more north you go, the more it warms. Climate change may be worse for the changes in the temperature gradients from north to south than for global warming.

2. The Arctic sea ice plays a crucial role in the Holocene climate. If there is no ice for the summer heat to consume, it will get very warm very fast. Then the Polar Night comes and temperatures will fall below 0. All that water released by heat and an open Arctic ocean will fall as ungodly snow. If we lose the Arctic sea ice we lose our world.

3. The effects of these injections are temporary, so the best time and place to use them is during summer over the Arctic, when there is maximum insolation. Because it will be day most of the time the cooling effect works 24/7 for the duration of the aerosols.  As an added benefit the very far northern regions are not ads green as the rest of the world and are less inhabited than middle Earth.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-27 19:36:03,"akea0u","Archimid",0,3,0,TRUE,2013-10-17 13:57:51,1101,121,1688,139355,142265,6,NA,"Managing Uncertainties in Climate Engineering",1,6,0,2019-01-27 17:47:33,2019-01-27

**Abstract**

Committed warming describes how much future warming can be expected from historical emissions due to inertia in the climate system. It is usually defined in terms of the level of warming above the present for an abrupt halt of emissions. Owing to socioeconomic constraints, this situation is unlikely, so we focus on the committed warming from present-day fossil fuel assets. Here we show that if carbon-intensive infrastructure is phased out at the end of its design lifetime from the end of 2018, there is a 64% chance that peak global mean temperature rise remains below 1.5 °C. Delaying mitigation until 2030 considerably reduces the likelihood that 1.5 °C would be attainable even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated. Although the challenges laid out by the Paris Agreement are daunting, we indicate 1.5 °C remains possible and is attainable with ambitious and immediate emission reduction across all sectors.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-21 02:38:46,"ai5hao","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,21,NA,"To Hold Warming to 1.5 Degrees, Study Says Nations Must Stop Building New Fossil Fuel Infrastructure Immediately",0.93,21,0,2019-01-21 02:37:59,2019-01-21

**Abstract**

Deep sea geological records indicate that Antarctic ice-sheet growth and decay is strongly influenced by the Earth’s astronomical variations (known as Milankovitch cycles), and that the frequency of the glacial–interglacial cycles changes through time. Here we examine the emergence of a strong obliquity (axial tilt) control on Antarctic ice-sheet evolution during the Miocene by correlating the Antarctic margin geological records from 34 to 5 million years ago with a measure of obliquity sensitivity that compares the variance in deep sea sediment core oxygen-isotope data at obliquity timescales with variance of the calculated obliquity forcing. Our analysis reveals distinct phases of ice-sheet evolution and suggests the sensitivity to obliquity forcing increases when ice-sheet margins extend into marine environments. We propose that this occurs because obliquity-driven changes in the meridional temperature gradient affect the position and strength of the circum-Antarctic easterly flow and enhance (or reduce) ocean heat transport across the Antarctic continental margin. The influence of obliquity-driven changes in ocean dynamics is amplified when marine ice sheets are extensive, and sea ice is limited. Our reconstruction of the Antarctic ice-sheet history suggests that if sea-ice cover decreases in the coming decades, ocean-driven melting at the ice-sheet margin will be amplified.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-18 03:17:49,"ah64nf","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,1,NA,"Antarctic ice sheet could suffer a one-two climate punch - if sea-ice cover decreases in the coming decades, ocean-driven melting at the ice-sheet margin will be amplified.",0.67,1,0,2019-01-18 03:16:55,2019-01-18

* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's a short training on How to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). 

* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/media-training/print-media/writing-effective-letters-to-the-editor/) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). 

* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  

* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). 

* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.

* At my request, 4 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend. 

* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend. We're still awaiting a vote, but things are looking hopeful, with several council members already committed to support. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/).

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Wind-generated ocean waves drive important coastal processes that determine flooding and erosion. Ocean warming has been one factor affecting waves globally. Most studies have focused on studying parameters such as wave heights, but a systematic, global and long-term signal of climate change in global wave behavior remains undetermined. Here we show that the global wave power, which is the transport of the energy transferred from the wind into sea-surface motion, has increased globally (0.4% per year) and by ocean basins since 1948. We also find long-term correlations and statistical dependency with sea surface temperatures, globally and by ocean sub-basins, particularly between the tropical Atlantic temperatures and the wave power in high south latitudes, the most energetic region globally. Results indicate the upper-ocean warming, a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger. This identifies wave power as a potentially valuable climate change indicator.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-16 20:25:19,"agpcm8","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"Upper-ocean warming is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger - The energy in ocean waves has been increasing as a consequence of climate change, according to a new study",1,10,0,2019-01-16 20:24:52,2019-01-16

**Abstract**

Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) rely upon Arctic sea ice as a physical habitat. Consequently, conservation assessments of polar bears identify the ongoing reduction in sea ice to represent a significant threat to their survival. However, the additional role of sea ice as a potential, indirect, source of energy to bears has been overlooked. Here we used the highly branched isoprenoid lipid biomarker-based index (H-Print) approach in combination with quantitative fatty acid signature analysis to show that sympagic (sea ice-associated), rather than pelagic, carbon contributions dominated the marine component of polar bear diet (72–100%; 99% CI, n = 55), irrespective of differences in diet composition. The lowest mean estimates of sympagic carbon were found in Baffin Bay bears, which were also exposed to the most rapidly increasing open water season. Therefore, our data illustrate that for future Arctic ecosystems that are likely to be characterised by reduced sea ice cover, polar bears will not only be impacted by a change in their physical habitat, but also potentially in the supply of energy to the ecosystems upon which they depend. This data represents the first quantifiable baseline that is critical for the assessment of likely ongoing changes in energy supply to Arctic predators as we move into an increasingly uncertain future for polar ecosystems.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-10 18:57:02,"aem4y5","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,5,NA,"Polar bears rely on seasonal sea ice as their habitat on which to travel and to hunt – but the true extent of their reliance has only just been discovered.

Earth system models are complex and represent a large number of processes, resulting in a persistent spread across climate projections for a given future scenario. Owing to different model performances against observations and the lack of independence among models, there is now evidence that giving equal weight to each available model projection is suboptimal. This Perspective discusses newly developed tools that facilitate a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation of model simulations with observations, process-based emergent constraints that are a promising way to focus evaluation on the observations most relevant to climate projections, and advanced methods for model weighting. These approaches are needed to distil the most credible information on regional climate changes, impacts, and risks for stakeholders and policy-makers.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-08 18:12:03,"adx37z","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,2,NA,"Climate model uncertainties ripe to be squeezed - The latest climate models and observations offer unprecedented opportunities to reduce the remaining uncertainties in future climate change, according to a new study.",1,2,0,2019-01-08 18:11:14,2019-01-08

___

**Significance**

Since the 19th century, rising greenhouse gas concentrations have caused the ocean to absorb most of the Earth’s excess heat and warm up. Before the 1990s, most ocean temperature measurements were above 700 m and therefore, insufficient for an accurate global estimate of ocean warming. We present a method to reconstruct ocean temperature changes with global, full-depth ocean coverage, revealing warming of 436 ×10^21 J since 1871. Our reconstruction, which agrees with other estimates for the well-observed period, demonstrates that the ocean absorbed as much heat during 1921–1946 as during 1990–2015. Since the 1950s, up to one-half of excess heat in the Atlantic Ocean at midlatitudes has come from other regions via circulation-related changes in heat transport.

**Abstact**

Most of the excess energy stored in the climate system due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has been taken up by the oceans, leading to thermal expansion and sea-level rise. The oceans thus have an important role in the Earth’s energy imbalance. Observational constraints on future anthropogenic warming critically depend on accurate estimates of past ocean heat content (OHC) change. We present a reconstruction of OHC since 1871, with global coverage of the full ocean depth. Our estimates combine timeseries of observed sea surface temperatures with much longer historical coverage than those in the ocean interior together with a representation (a Green’s function) of time-independent ocean transport processes. For 1955–2017, our estimates are comparable with direct estimates made by infilling the available 3D time-dependent ocean temperature observations. We find that the global ocean absorbed heat during this period at a rate of 0.30 ± 0.06 W/m^2 in the upper 2,000 m and 0.028 ± 0.026 W/m^2 below 2,000 m, with large decadal fluctuations. The total OHC change since 1871 is estimated at 436 ± 91 ×10^21 J, with an increase during 1921–1946 (145 ± 62 ×10^21 J) that is as large as during 1990–2015. By comparing with direct estimates, we also infer that, during 1955–2017, up to one-half of the Atlantic Ocean warming and thermosteric sea-level rise at low latitudes to midlatitudes emerged due to heat convergence from changes in ocean transport.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-08 00:15:41,"ado63p","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,7,NA,"Global warming of the oceans of 436 x 10^21 Joules has occurred from 1871 to present (roughly 1000 times annual worldwide human primary energy consumption) and that comparable warming happened over the periods 1920-1945 and 1990-2015.",0.9,7,0,2019-01-08 00:13:21,2019-01-08

"edf8ddd",1,"I haven't had the time yet to go through this particular study at length, however, a cursory read through of the article you provide pointing to a value of 862 tetragrams suggests one should note the technical differences between the article and the findings of this study. Note that this study only looks at the neotropics while your article looks at tropical forests in Asia, and Africa as well. Furthermore, this study only looks at soil carbon, no other sources or sinks. The implication is that your back of the envelope estimation of 4-5 metric megatons is far too high and needs to be revised within the scope of this study. 

A quick scan for detailed values within the study shows the following:

""*A reasonable range of soil CO2 efflux rates in this forest is 4 to 7 kg CO2 m^(-2) yr^(-1) (as in this study, and in Schwendenmann &amp; Veldkamp, 2006), and nest surface area ranges from 30 to 70 m^2 (Wirth et al. 2003, based on Perfecto &amp; Vandermeer, 1993; Table 2; Table S5). Given these values, soil ground surface of a nest emits 120 to 490 kg CO2 annually. For vent efflux, based on an observed average vent efflux value of 2.1·10^(4)kg CO2 m^(-2) yr^(-1), an average of 32 vents per mature nest, and average vent opening (0.00021 m^(2)), the total vent CO2 emissions is about 72 kg CO2 yr^(-1). These values suggest that an average Atta cephalotes nest area emits around 200 kg to 600 kg CO2
per nest and year, i.e., 15% to 60% more than an equivalent area of soil in a lowland tropical forest... at least 1.2% of the La Selva surface of primary and secondary forest was occupied by Atta cephalotes nests.

**Abstract**

Leaf‐cutter ants are dominant herbivores that disturb the soil and create biogeochemical hot spots. We studied how leaf‐cutter ant Atta cephalotes impacts soil CO2 dynamics in a wet Neotropical forest. We measured soil CO2 concentration monthly over 2.5 years at multiple depths in non‐nest and nest soils (some of which were abandoned during the study) and assessed CO2 production. We also measured nest and non‐nest soil efflux, nest vent efflux and vent concentration. Nest soils exhibited lower CO2 accumulation than non‐nest soils for the same precipitation amounts. During wet periods, soil CO2 concentrations increased across all depths, but were significantly less in nest than in non‐nest soils. Differences were non‐significant during drier periods. Surface efflux was equal across nest and non‐nest plots (5 μmol CO2 m^(‐2) s^(‐1)), while vent efflux was substantially (10^(3) to 10^(5) times) greater, a finding attributed to free convection and sporadic forced convection. Vent CO2 concentrations were less than in soil, suggesting CO2 efflux from the soil matrix into the nest. Legacy effects in abandoned nests were still observable after more than two years. These findings indicate that leaf‐cutter ant nests provide alternative transport pathways to soil CO2 that increase total emissions and decrease soil CO2 concentrations, and have a lasting impact. Estimated total nest‐soil CO2 emissions were 15 to 60% more than in non‐nest soils, equivalent to 0.2 to 0.7% greater ecosystem‐scale soil emissions. The observed CO2 dynamics illuminate the significant carbon footprint of ecosystem engineer Atta cephalotes and have biogeochemical implications for rainforest ecosystems.

**Plain Language Summary**

Leaf‐cutter ants modify their habitat to the extent that they are called ecosystem engineers. Living throughout the Americas, they construct massive nests to which they import the vegetation they harvest to feed a fungus they cultivate as their main food source. We studied the most common leaf‐cutter ant in Costa Rica to assess the impact of its nests on carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in surrounding soils and on soil CO2 emissions. In the Costa Rican rainforest, heavy rains easily clog the clayey soils, accumulating CO2 from microbial and root respiration. During wet periods, we observed lower CO2 concentrations in nest soils relative to non‐nest soils. We attribute this difference to the nest structure, which provides ventilation for both nest CO2 and the CO2 originated in the surrounding soil. We also found that soil CO2 emissions were the same in nest and non‐nest soils, but nest openings had emissions 100,000 times greater. Consequently, nests and their surrounding soils emit 15 to 60% more CO2 than the equivalent non‐nest soil areas. This difference, together with the expanding range of leaf‐cutter ants, favored by human activities and warmer climate, has implications with respect to the global carbon cycle.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-06 06:25:11,"ad34yx","avogadros_number",0,1,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,10,NA,"Humans are not the only animals to build elaborate housing and grow crops—or to add carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere through their industry.

**Deep Pacific cooling**

Earth's climate cooled considerably across the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age about 700 years ago. Theoretically, owing to how the ocean circulates, this cooling should be recorded in Pacific deep-ocean temperatures, where water that was on the surface then is found today. Gebbie and Huybers used an ocean circulation model and observations from both the end of the 19th century and the end of the 20th century to detect and quantify this trend. The ongoing deep Pacific is cooling, which revises Earth's overall heat budget since 1750 downward by 35%.

**Abstract**

Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent cooling occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean.","GlobalClimateChange",2019-01-05 04:31:52,"acqo3e","avogadros_number",0,2,0,TRUE,2013-05-10 02:07:55,0,0,514266,26546,540812,16,NA,"Cold waters that sank in polar regions hundreds of years ago during the Little Ice Age are still impacting deep Pacific Ocean temperature trends.

Looking through the literature on the topic, it seems like there's a pretty wide spread in the model estimates, with some models projecting the first (effectively) ""ice free"" minimum extents showing up prior to 1940, even with the RCP4.5 emissions. Is it really safe to say it would be ""at least 2040""?","climate_science",2019-01-02 23:35:36,"abttdk","BelfreyE",0,2,0,TRUE,2014-08-15 11:43:16,408,0,1029,20621,22058,6,"I found an earlier discussion on the timing of the first sea-ice free arctic summer (https://www.reddit.com/r/climate_science/comments/82rxst/blue_ocean_event_unsure_where_to_find_information/) and the most upvoted comment is one stating that the arctic won't be ice free in summer until the 2040's or 2050's, this being presumably motivated by models.

"ed3uu2u",7,"When people talk about ice-free, they usually define it by some sea ice extent (surface area) metric, rather than sea ice volume. The relationship between sea ice extent and sea ice volume is not linear, so even if the future evolution of sea ice volume were linear, you still might not get an ice free summer if looking at a sea-ice extent metric. Sea ice volume is decreasing faster than sea ice extent because the sea ice is thinning as well as laterally shrinking.

If you repeat the same exercise you did above by [extrapolating the trend in sea ice extent](http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2018/12/Figure-3.png), you find that you won't see summers with less than 1 Million Sq Km of sea ice extent until ~2050s.

Another thing to remember, the ice that has melted so far is generally at lower latitudes and is more in proximity with warmer ocean currents (e.g. the extension of the Gulf Stream) and prone to fluctuations in the jet stream. The further you go North, the more the ice is shielded from these variations and is probably more stable in general.","climate_science",2019-01-02 22:04:58,"abttdk","[deleted]",0,7,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,6,"I found an earlier discussion on the timing of the first sea-ice free arctic summer (https://www.reddit.com/r/climate_science/comments/82rxst/blue_ocean_event_unsure_where_to_find_information/) and the most upvoted comment is one stating that the arctic won't be ice free in summer until the 2040's or 2050's, this being presumably motivated by models.

"ed3u5vy",4,"Two things:

1) The way Wang and Overland (2012) come up with ice free summer conditions ""in the 2030s"" are, in my opinion, very hand-wavy. The number that the models actually give them are:

""If we consider 1.0 million km2 as the summer ice free
condition (the horizontal dashed line crossing the colored lines
in Figure 2), then under the RCP8.5 scenario (magenta lines in
Figure 2) this condition will be reached by the ensemble
members of the seven selected models by 2040–2060.""

They use a fairly unjustified extrapolation to argue that the 2040-2060 range is maybe an overestimate because models are not accurately modelling the observed sea ice trends of the 20th century and come up with their ""2030s"" value.

2) Even the 2040-2060 value is already kind of sketchy to use as a prediction. It assumes we continue on a RCP8.5 trajectory, which I personally think is unlikely between now and 2040. Thus, their model simulations probably correspond to a world in which greenhouse gas forcing is higher than we will actually witness. This should buy us a few more years relative to the ""2030s"" or 2040-2060 value.","climate_science",2019-01-02 21:58:11,"abttdk","[deleted]",0,4,0,FALSE,NA,0,0,0,0,0,6,"I found an earlier discussion on the timing of the first sea-ice free arctic summer (https://www.reddit.com/r/climate_science/comments/82rxst/blue_ocean_event_unsure_where_to_find_information/) and the most upvoted comment is one stating that the arctic won't be ice free in summer until the 2040's or 2050's, this being presumably motivated by models.
