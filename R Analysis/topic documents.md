Climate Activist Spends 589 Days And Counting Picking Up Litter In Calif. Park
[https://www.npr.org/2021/03/08/974901455/climate-change-activist-spends-589-days-and-counting-picking-up-litter-in-calif](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/08/974901455/climate-change-activist-spends-589-days-and-counting-picking-up-litter-in-calif)   After spending 589 consecutive days picking up litter at one of Los Angeles County's most popular hiking spots, 20-year-old Edgar McGregor says the park is clean of municipal waste. But his job is far from over. The climate activist, who says he has autism, made the trip to Eaton Canyon — part of the Angeles National Forest in southern California — throughout the pandemic and in extreme weather, picking up litter left behind by visitors and posting his progress on social media. He announced on Friday that there was no more trash to be found, but that he plans to return several times a week for maintenance while also turning his attention to new parks. &#x200B; Reporter: [Green News](https://www.reddit.com/r/Green_News/)

Pave paradise, put up a parking lot
Parking lots ruin the cities of North America. I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada and at some point urban planning turned towards a focus on developing the suburbs, rather than the urban core. As a result, instead of going downtown, most people drive out to commercial parks to do their shopping. Local businesses suffer, rather than a thriving and pedestrian friendly downtown.    By suburban I mean urban planning centred on car dependency. These are neighbourhoods that are un-walkable, and characterized by stores with parking lots separating them from the street.    Dartmouth, the sister city of Halifax, is a prime example of low density urban planning. It is mainly a suburban city.    Not only are these areas harmful to the environment, they lack any sense of community. This results in alienating the citizens who live in these areas. I remember driving into large cities feeling an overwhelming sense of depression, seeing the endless rows of identical houses, strip malls and industrial parks. You couldn’t pay me to live in these areas without being bothered by this.    There are hopes for the future. Although these areas are impossible to renovate and unlikely to be demolished, it can be subsided and future development can return to a focus on developing the downtown core. There is a current shift of focus towards the inner city, with new residences and high rises going up.    In my opinion, it isn’t as much the residential neighbourhoods that need intervention (aside from the lack of architectural output in some neighbourhoods). It is more the commercial areas that should be designed to be pedestrian friendly.    Shopping malls should be encouraged, as there is a great sense of community. Downtown parking should be encouraged with high rise parking garages. This means sidewalks, higher density, and high rises. Rather than driving into every store, people could park in a garage and walk out into a thriving downtown core that is both fun and beautiful to be a part ... <truncated>

Corte europea diritti umani condanna la Svizzera in materia di cambiamenti climatici
Nella lotta per la giustizia climatica, un nuovo strumento sta emergendo: la "Climate change litigation", ovvero l'utilizzo di azioni legali per contrastare i cambiamenti climatici. Il 9 aprile 2024, la Corte europea dei diritti umani ha emesso una storica sentenza nel caso Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz contro Svizzera. In questo contesto è stato riconosciuto che la Svizzera ha violato l'articolo 8 della CEDU (diritto alla vita privata e familiare) non adottando misure sufficienti per tutelare i cittadini dagli effetti del cambiamento climatico.    II caso dovrebbe però invitarci a riflettere sulla necessità di un nuovo patto sociale tra generazioni per  garantire un pianeta più giusto per coloro che subiranno gli effetti delle nostre scelte.

If Al Gore was considered a champion of climate change reform, why did underneath his family make deals with Russian Oil companies such as Occidental petroleum?
GORE RECOGNIZED that his relationship with Hammer and his company did not look good. In 1992, before President Clinton settled on him as his running mate, Gore’s father wrote a memo for Clinton on his ties to Occidental to prepare him for possible questions about it. After the election, however, Gore resumed his old relationship with the company and its new chairman, Ray Irani. Occidental, for example, loaned $100,000 to the Presidential Inaugural Committee to help pay for the ceremony and the celebrations surrounding it. And Gore used his connections to bring in money from Occidental for the Clinton/Gore re-election campaign. According to a memo from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, Occidental gave $50,000 in response to one of Gore’s “no controlling legal authority” telephone calls from his office in the White House. Indeed, since Gore became part of the Democratic ticket in the summer of 1992, Occidental has given more than $470,000 in soft money to various Democratic committees and causes. https://publicintegrity.org/politics/how-the-gores-father-and-son-helped-their-patron-occidental-petroleum/

The Trillion-Gallon Question: What if California’s Dams Fail?
From the piece as it goes from NorCal to SoCa … l”.. climate change requires a different kind of adaptation. What if, rather than trying to out-engineer the weather, or evacuate and return in an endless cycle, we changed where and how we live? It would be not an administrative feat but a psychological one, an attempt to check, in John McPhee’s words, “the powerful fabric of ambition that impelled people to build towns and cities where almost any camper would be loath to pitch a tent.” Americans aren’t good at retreating, and the ones who wound up in California, the cliché goes, are the people who didn’t stop pushing forward until they ran out of continent. The Indigenous population, though, knew a floodplain when they saw one. Is it unimaginable that we might learn that lesson as we unlearn the ones of the 20th century?”

Rockefeller.  When asked about climate change the band changed the subject to personal responsibility and threatened to “Punch everyone in the nose.” if they kept asking questions. At an awards ceremony for the band the American Petroleum Institute and British Airways and Sewers presented the band with a small, replica power plant to celebrate their multi-billion ton success.  “What we’re most proud of” said guitarist Margaret Thatcher “is all the little power plants that opened up after us.

We Rated Urban Forests in 8 Cities – Only Singapore Passed the Test!
Can you see three trees from your home, school or workplace? Is there tree canopy cover shading at least 30% of the surrounding neighbourhood? Can you find a park within 300 metres of the building? These three simple questions form the basis of the “3+30+300 rule” for greener, healthier, more heat tolerant cities. This simple measure, originally devised in Europe and now gaining traction around the world, sets the minimum standard required to experience the health benefits of nature in cities. We put the rule to the test in eight global cities: Melbourne, Sydney, New York, Denver, Seattle, Buenos Aires, Amsterdam and Singapore. Most buildings in these cities failed to meet the 3+30+300 rule. We found canopy cover in desperately short supply, even in some of the most affluent, iconic cities on the planet. Better canopy cover is urgently needed to cool our cities in the face of climate change.

Exactly how worried should I be about dog poop contaminating my neighbors well?
I live with my mom. Shes had dogs since we've lived here. 22 years. She doesn't pick up her dogs shit ever. Our neighbor has a well, and im worried the dog poop is contaminating it.

Require employers to pay employees for commutes
Work-from-home went so well for a year or two. Many employees became more productive as a result. Now there's a push to make them return to the office, and there doesn't seem to be a reason other than "corporate says so."          The impact on emissions was marvelous. Not only were there fewer miles driven, but drivers could move from point A to point B without sitting in so much traffic. Putting an end to work-from-home is like, "we need to wreck the planet because I'm your boss and you need to respect me." Let them eat cake.     And what's nuts is employers don't pay their employees for the time required to commute, let alone the cost of owning and maintaing an extra vehicle. Yes, I said an \*extra\* vehicle - because the stay-at-home spouse might need to run errands, or the two-income household might have two commutes, or maybe the household could do without any vehicles at all, if not for the commute.     Require employers to pay employees for commutes. And not just hourly. It's ballpark $10K in transportation costs for the employee to own, maintain, and insure a car.

electric vehicles
I recently received an electric van from work and was pleasantly surprised by how the van drove. However, the lack of charging points and charging points that actually work is horrendous. This has completely put me off ever buying an electric car for myself. Once searched for hours to find a charging point that works then have to get back home somehow and then 10 hours later the van is finally charged but with only 150 miles max range. Unless you have a driveway and can put your own charging point in it is a complete waste of time and even if you did have your own charging place at your home its still a waste of time as on a couple of occasions already I've had to ditch the van for my petrol powered c63 because somethings come up which I needed to get there quickly and I couldn't do that in an electric vehicle because either the range isn't enough or you would have to stop and do the fast charging which is expensive and still not fast. I support trying to lower emissions but leave cars alone there's got to be a better way than living with an electric vehicle. Will never buy an electric car personally as just way too much faff and there's no infrastructure to support it.

Things will be forbidden and bonfires is one of them
So I was at this company dinner with a barbeque. Fantastic setting in the Swedish archipelago: huge tents and several grills in the countryside with chirping birds and soothing sun. We had been enjoying saunas, 16 degrees bathing and wood-fueled bathtubs. Now, there were some of us who enjoyed the occasional niconitene Serenity. Some did vape and others like me had a cigarette. The last cigarette I had I threw in one of the controlled braziers. This caused the remark: "Wasnt that a filtered cigarette? Thats plastic" To which I replied: "Yeah it will burn. Or I throw it in the bin over there and they will burn it". Sure. There would hopefully be some filtering on the garbage burning which catches the filter but really? Aa The guy is at a luxury resort, burning the world energy all over the place and reacts to my cigarette stump? All the barbeque and bonfires we burnt caused massive damage compared to the cigarette stump i burnt. Am I the only that sense a lack of proportions?

I have to vent for a second.
I was outside yesterday, shoveling snow. Both my neighbours cars honked and the engines started (they have remote starters I suppose). They sat there idling for a few minutes before anyone came out of the house.     They then proceeded to start shoveling snow, letting both cars idle the whole time. These are people who leave their engines running until the coolant temperature reaches the thermostat setting.     This is an exceptionally selfish thing to do, and is precisely the kind of behaviour that's got us into the situation we're in. They're not only pumping loads of extra poison into the atmosphere (solely for their own comfort), they're ruining the crankshaft bearings and costing themselves money unnecessarily.     What really kills me is that I don't have kids, and they do. You'd think they'd be the ones concerned about global warming, and I'd be the one who didn't care. How oblivious, stupid and selfish do you have to be to do this?    It's infuriating, I'm so sick and tired of watching people act like this.

MOTORCYCLES; DUH.
BICYCLES! Everyone is talking about bicycles.     Nobody is assuming you could pedal 40km to work every morning, unless you are into stuff like that. You know. Torture. Still bicycles are an important addition.     So are motorcycles. Not sure what´s with folks in the US; but the EU seems to really fucking hate motorcycles though. Or just the worldbank and who? And no im not crazy, read it.  In Germany it is somehow not contradictory to be the goddamn green party and want to ban motorcycles from riding on certain roads on the weekends.      [Motorcycles | Mobility and transport (europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/knowledge/vehicle/safety_design_needs/motorcycles_en)     A 100+hp motorcycle gets better mileage than a Toyota Prius let alone any car that could hope to be as fast.     A 15hp 125cc bike emits so little C02 it can easily hang with electric cars, at much lower cost. Kawasaki is developing a hybrid approach atm, though given the market it certainly will not be a combo of a 125cc bike with a hefty electric punch. Still it is possible to do that. 65-75mph top speed is allright, but the sleep-inducing acceleration of 125cc bikes could be fixed with a 10-20 hp kick in the butt. Considering electric motors are actually very lightweight but batteries are not, a hybrid approach seems very appealing, combining a range of perhaps 10-30 miles, variable depending on how long your way to work is, with the fuel motor that is there when you need it, getting 400+miles out of 11 liters of fuel.     I realize that motorcycles are dangerous but everyone should be made aware and decide for themselves .... seperate lanes protecting motorcycles and perhaps narrow efficient cars would be a possible remedy to that.     Safety is an endless argument. You saw the video of a tank drifting into oncoming traffic? The tank was just fine!

I propose a new regulation to alleviate climate change
Just finished driving from Georgia to Seattle, and really annoyed by all the enormous Diesel Trucks that idle their huge diesel engines all night long at rest stops and any other stops.   Not talking about the refridgeration units, the actual huge truck engine running all night long to keep the Cab heated or cooled (Fall in Savannah was still pretty warm).    &#x200B;    Surely the trucks can be built with an additional smaller engine to keep the Cab sleeper unit comfortable enough for the driver to sleep the required amount.   Seems to me they are wasting an enormous amount of fuel.   Better yet, how about Feds install  way, way more electric charging stations all around major interstates, and make it mandatory for the Truckers to use them plugged into their cabs, instead of running the big diesel motor all night long ?

What is more environmentally friendly - Biking to work, or taking a 50 CC scooter?
This is a discussion I was having with my Brother. One of us takes a bicycle for their commute, the other typically rides a 50cc moped. For reference, the moped is using 87 octane gas, and gets about 110 MPG.               Of course the bike has no direct pollution, which at face-value makes this an easy, debate, but we wanted to take this a step further and get very technical. Riding the moped does not require any additional exercise (perhaps one or two calories more than driving a car). The bike, on the other hand, is relatively calorie intensive.               The real question is this: How many calories does a bike use over 110 miles, and what is the environmental impact of those additional calories?

The fence pictured is the photo separates mine, and my neighbors house. There is an embankment that's slops down maybe 8 feet, or around there.

I have no idea where my neighbors well is located, but assume I threw it like 5 feet from her well. Would that contaminate her well? I know I never threw it directly into her yard, as that would be completely inconsiderate, not that i was already being inconsiderate. What should I do? I can't find out her phone number, and her property is gated off. I might be able to enter it if I walk through the forest, but idk how shed react to that.

The cost of heavy vehicles.
I wanted to share some rough estimates we ran through at work with you.    We were comparing the fuel consumption of myself (a gentle driver who owns a small, efficient car) and a co-worker (an aggressive driver who drives a pickup truck).     My car is 2.0 L, his truck is 5.4 L. (x 2.7 displacement)    I drive at the speed limit, he drives twenty over along the same route (+ %20)    My car has a curb weight of 1270 kg, his truck is 2110 kg (x 1.66 mass)    If we assume those are all linear relationships for simplicity (they're not), it's not a far stretch to claim he uses triple the fuel I do. My car is quoted as producing 124 g/km of CO2. Using the same multiplier, he would potentially produce 372 g/km.     Now imagine all the people (especially in North America) driving big, heavy vehicles that don't need to. Imagine how much extra emissions they produce every year.    Most people justify buying these vehicles either because they need the space, or they're safer. When everyone else is driving a big vehicle too, they aren't any safer, and studies have shown that 95% of pickup drivers do not use them for carrying loads.

Earth day today, celebrating the bees. Meanwhile some dumb ass poisoned my hive.
So yesterday we had a dude around to check out the hive to see why there numbers were so low. (we obeyed the lockdown restrictions)    So it turns out somebody has poisoned our hive, most certainly not deliberately however its likely they either sprayed something on the bees or have put out poisoned bait and the bees have brought it back to the hive.    The queen is still alive though barely however all the larvae are dead and so are half the workers, its coming into winter so the hive is pretty much a goner.    Sadly we are in a rather suburbanite area so we have a lot of neighbors. Please people, if you see a lot of bees in your back yard, do not assume you have an infestation and then poison them.    Bees arn't bad leave them alone.

I was planning on getting a hybrid, as I can not afford an electric and I rent so charging would be a hassle and Id have to rent a garage(more money per month).    My concern is, is it truly the greener choice? I've read the manufacturing process can, in fact, produce more emissions in a hybrid than a regular car. What do you think?    Choice of car (2020/2021):    &#x200B;    1. Hyundai Sonata Hybrid  2. Hyundai Sonata  3. Honda Accord    Thank you!

Flora Fauna UV Toxicity = Ozone Depletion + Magnetic Field Depletion
Earths magnetic field is depleting 5% per decade. It is more pronounced in a vast area that runs from South Africa to most of South America. Satellites have to be shut down for their own safety over these areas. Scientists will tell you that pole flips take thousands of years. That's not true. They will reassure us to say the magnetic field is strengthening in other areas. That's irrelevent.    When the poles do flip, and they can flip in under 100 years, multiple poles develop and can take decades to pass overhead, during which time you'll be blasted with toxic radiation that harms both plants and humans.    Most of earth's ozone is right over your head, and that's whats never stopped depleting.

[No Soil & Water Before 100% Renewable Energy](https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/no-soil-water-before-100-renwable-energy/)    When Bill McKibben wanted to name 350 dot org, he kept pestering James Hansen for the number he considered safe for CO2 concentrations, Scientists don't like hard numbers, but Bill persisted so James relented. Soon after telling Bill 350, James reconsidered and restated the safe number was 300. Bill didn't care, he already printed the stationary and t-shirts.    Bill invited James to a small protest in front of the White House for a promotional photo op.    James Hansen was promoting 100% private carbon tax dividends, where all the tax money on wealthy people would all go back to the poor. This means zero money for governments and corporations. Well guess who hates that idea? Governments and corporations, especially socialist governments.    Immediately after the photo-op, Senators Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders sponsored a bill that would allow the federal government to sequester ( steal ) 40% of any such dividends, effectively gutting Hansen's proposal. Bill McKibben, the Sierra Club, the WWF are all frauds who act as front men for corporations exactly the way TreeHugger works for the logging industry.

Nutrient Dilution as a Driver for Mass Species Extinctions
The following article was published a few months ago in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: [https://www.pnas.org/content/117/13/7271.short](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/13/7271.short)  [https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2020/03/10/814130193/why-taller-grass-can-be-bad-news-for-grasshoppers](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2020/03/10/814130193/why-taller-grass-can-be-bad-news-for-grasshoppers)  The study monitored changes in grasshopper populations in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem in Kansas over the past 20 years. As atmospheric carbon levels increased, grasses grew taller, but levels of key nutrients and minerals (N, P, K) decreased, in some cases by up to 50% over 20 years. Grasshopper populations declined at a rate of 2-3% per year and were explained to a large extent by decreases in nutrient levels, in addition to temperature and climate oscillation. The authors identified \~50 additional articles reporting significant declines in plant nutrient concentrations over time - in not only grasses, but woody plants, trees, legumes, and agricultural crops across the world.  More than half of all insect species are herbivorous - including moths, butterflies, beetles, weevils, and aphids. Based on what I remember from my college-level ecology classes, 90% of insect biomass is made up of herbivores. As our insect populations crash, how will that affect populations of wildlife that feed on them? Furthermore, based on the above trends, grass forage will have little to no nutritional value within 25-50 years. How will that affect other populations of herbivorous mammals and the species that prey on them? TL/DR: Nutrient dilution receives very little media attention or discussion in the climate forums but could result in the extinction of a large number of herbivorous animals (and others that depend on them) over the next 50 to 100-years.

Only 4% Of Animals Are Wild
When Europeans first sailed to Canada there were so many fish they thought the boat would tip over.    At the same time there were more Caribbean sea turtles by weight than buffalo across the great plains.    At the same time the passenger pigeon migration would block out the noon day sun.    By weight, 96% of all frog fish bird on land is human and livestock.    4% of land vertebrate biomass is wildlife. Humans and livestock caused 80% of all species extinction.    We have cut 50% of earth's trees in 2,000 years, most in the last 50 years.    Human and livestock habitat is being destroyed in a way that cannot be stopped or reversed.    When mass extinction starts it cannot be stopped.    Mass distribution of fluorine and chlorine mixed with carbon is destroying human plant habitat.    This unstoppable irreversible degradation also happens to the human brain in zero gravity and bad air.    The petro fluoro chloral poisoning has a cognitive and reproductive inter-generational effect across all fish frog bird human or livestock because the chemicals last forever. Plastic turns into nano plastic.    We are poisoning all classes of vertebrate to kill bugs and weeds. This affects the cognitive and reproductive survival of both bugs and all classes of vertebrates.    The farm fields are poison deserts, we have so much food because we are growing it wrong.    The dinosaur mass extinction took 10,000 years, the human and livestock use of petrochemicals has shortened mass extinction to 50 years. We are not beginning or in the middle of a mass extinction, it's already over.    No studies have been done on how 100,000 chemicals in our systems interact negatively for species propagation safety and health. These effects can't be stopped or reversed and accumulate inter generationally.    The pandemics are because of our mistreatment of livestocks soils and plants.

Air pollution threatens natural pest control
When fields of oilseed rape are exposed to diesel exhaust and/or ozone – both found in emissions from diesel burning vehicles and industry – the number of parasitic insects available to control aphids drops significantly, according to research led by scientists from the University of Reading.    The team used special equipment to deliver controlled amounts of diesel exhaust and ozone to oilseed rape plants. They also added aphids to the plants and measured the reproductive success of parasitic wasps that habitually lay their eggs inside a freshly stung aphid.

Why aren't more people switching to a plant-based diet?
There are so many dangers to factory farming and a diet high in animal products that I don't understand why more people aren't switching to a plant-based nutrition plan. Between the greenhouse gases, land use, water use, eutrophication, and zoonotic diseases, to the overwhelming evidence of eating animals and the increased prevalence of heart disease (TMAO), type 2 diabetes, and cancer (IGF-1), it just seems like a no-brainer.

The Bitter Truth: How Climate Change threatening the Global Tea Industry - Newsblare
Planters’ body Indian Tea Association (ITA) said climate change is threatening the tea industry globally, resulting in lower yields and higher production costs. Climate change also threatening the long-term viability of the tea industry, causing pest infestations that make pesticide residue management a major issue.

This is how you raise animals in agriculture!
Animal systems can be used to clear gardens for permanent systems, or they can be used as part of system cycles to rip up organic matter, eat insects, eat weed seeds, and increase fertility. All the while the animals are doing what they love to do while also providing eggs and meat. Here, at Zaytuna Farm, we are cell grazing with cattle inside of swale trenches and Muscovy ducks on top of swale mounds.   Ducks, chickens, geese, and turkeys can all be used similarly to the Muscovies. Larger animals like cattle need to be very carefully managed with rotational grazing to prevent damaging the system.         [https://youtu.be/xgsf7EM\_BNk](https://youtu.be/xgsf7EM_BNk)

Only 4% of Animals Are Wild -> There are 100 million registered chemicals
**Runaway Hothouse Mass Extinction** \-> What you need to know    The remaining 4% of wildlife are due to imminent collapse due to climate and poisoning.    There are 100 million registered chemicals, growing by 4,000 per day pre-covid. While the polar ozone hole is closing, the thicker ozone blanket everywhere else never stopped depleting. Air conditioning alone will use up all our renewable energy by 2050. But we won't make it that long. AC chemicals are smuggled into Europe and the US by China all the time. Gender bending PFAS have 5,000 derivatives.    Fluorine and chlorine mixed with petrochemicals are destroying all species and the planet's atmosphere.    There were 4 billion person flights per year pre-covid.    There are 25 billion chickens on earth, we drug the crap out them. They are so mutated that they can barely stand up by themselves. Our mistreatment of livestock is so severe that pig and chicken flu pandemics are inevitable.    The only thing that saved us from the crash of '08 was fracking. US oil exports grew 1,000% in 10 years. Methane from livestock, permafrost and frack wells is at record high. Europe and America are entering mega drought territory.    Yes kids ( I can't believe I have to say this in an environment sub ) 5G is not a holy sacrament. EMF saturation is deleterious to the health of all living things. A little mercury won't kill you, but mercury saturation will. Humans have zero tolerance to zero gravity. Even our drugs are poisoned. There is no such thing as a hi-tech ecosystem. Hi-tech ecosystem is an abominable oxymoron.    When Bayer bought Monsanto, it combined the people who sell poison with the people who sell medicine for that poison. This is called stupid. As in stupid beyond belief. There are over 100 thousand chemicals in our air, land, fabrics, materials and water. Very few are health and safety tested and nobody knows what effect they have cumulatively and inter-sectionally. Chemicals don't like to self-isolate.    The o ... <truncated>

I feel hopeless.
I'm a minor and I honestly feel hopeless for my future. I try to get involved as much as I can, recycle and reduce waste usage, that kinda stuff... but at this point I just feel like nothing I do matters.    I've gotten to a point where I genuinely want to live, but there's so much fear-inducing content and pessimism out there - I just feel so scared. I'm trying not to lose ALL hope, because without any I don't know what I'd do, but I'm honestly so stressed it's been taking a toll on my mental and physical health.     I guess I just want to know I'm not alone, and maybe some positive things that are going on. It seems no matter what I seach for its always bad news.

It's hard to care about climate change.
I have beed depressed for some 9-10 years now and I can't make myself care about the climate change when I can hardly care about getting a meal eaten daily.    I know its a big thing, but whats the huss when everything feels pretty useless anyway.     My friends are pretty hippish and they often say I am being reckless and an idiot for not caring enogh, but how in hell I could start to care about future when I cant even think what I'm going to do with my life tomorrow.     I just feel myself as a bad person when this happens.

What the hell are we supposed to do now?
At this point, I feel like we’re screwed. Antarctica is melting and all these companies and everything else bla blah blah it’s all shit man. I just wish people would listen for once. I want to be calm about this but it’s just so hard when I feel completely powerless to this kind of situation. I can’t go too far since people obviously wouldn’t like that but then what else can we even do? The world is only getting worse and worse and I’m just starting to become hopeless. But then I have to choose between doing my dream job/passion vs trying to protect the planet. I’m just so tired of it all, why do we have to suffer for everyone else’s consequences?..    That’s all for now.

I’m so tired
As much as I know I shouldn’t be a doomer, I’ve just completely given up hope. I’ve grown up my whole life being hyper aware of everything politicians have done to wrong the world and I am witnessing the affects of CC tenfold. I know that even if I try my hardest (which I do), the people who have the most power over changing it don’t care and would rather watch us burn for a crisp dollar. I’m just waiting to die from heat stroke or something at this point because I just don’t care anymore    Again, it’s not to say I won’t still do my part, I just have no faith anything will change. If things keep getting worse then being a shut in doesn’t sound that bad anymore. I encourage all of you to keep going, and I will too, but my faith in that activism actually doing something is just gone.    I don’t know. I just needed to rant about this somehow.

Why does it feel like no one cares ?
Everyday I realize how bad this is and how much it’s affecting our lives and our planet. But when I talk to people about it, they just say “ it’s too late” or “whatever” or “what am I gonna do” like it’s as if they think that one person can’t make a difference. And yes here I am saying stuff and what am I doing. I’m 19 I can’t really do much I’m barely getting by to survive. But what I do is make sure I’m recycling, using reusable items. Save water. Etc. I do all the things I can do from home or in the public like not littering and more. And if every person could just do that we might have a little more of a chance and it just sucks how much power the politicians have is just ridiculous, we have these people just making decisions for the rest of us 🤦🏽‍♂️.  But yeah sorry it’s just frustrating that our planet is dying and people act like nothing is happening.

I want to enjoy life like the "good old days" the adults talk about, but I can't. Even having a little fun makes me feel guilty.

Every time it seems like things are getting a little better, something worse happens somewhere else. It’s hard to make sense of it. The politics surrounding climate change also make it feel like no one is really taking it seriously. As someone who loves nature and animals, I’m honestly starting to lose hope. Is there even a point to trying anymore? It feels like humanity won’t sort this out.

Which makes sense to me sense we are getting closer to the turning point and there is more news on it.

I feel so helpless, but I can't do anything to stop this mess. I don't wanna wake up every day for the rest of my life to the news of more wildfires, flods, crops dying, I would prefer to just sleep and never wake up then to see that, my heart and mind can't handle it. I feel cheated, by only being 19, the begnning of my life and to live in the last age of being able to live comfortable on this rock, I'm angry, I'm sad, I feel almost constant dreed, and I don't know what to do. It's taking such a big toll on my familie to see me like this, but I just can't forget it! I live in Denmark where the summer is very mild, but I can't help but think that these summers will be few and far between in the future. My ocd dosn't help either, keeping me lingreing on all of this.

I'm too scared. My climate anxiety is back. I'm so scared of societal collapse. I'm scared of all of humanity ending. I'm tired of being emphatic. Honestly. I'm so scared  The people online, saying that we're doomed, that the catastrophic predictions are too optimistic. Even my friends are nihilistic about this. I'm tired. Why? Why do I deserve all of this? I'm only 15 goddamnit! When I'll be 50, instead of going to the bar with my future friends, I'll be scavenging for food, if I didn't die 10 years prior because of my crappy life conditions. I'm so scared. I cannot believe positive stuff anymore. Any person that says that it's not too bad seems stupid to me, and every person that says that I am right is a stab to my soul. Every time someone says that the collapse is exaggerated, someone in the comments says: "uh... No, you're wrong, here's a 100 pages long scientific paper on how We're all going to die in 50 years". People say: "Live! Do stuff! It might be bad, but it won't matter if you're worried! Accept death!" They seem do depressed. They might not realize, but those people are depressed too. They aren't happy. They're anxious and depressed just like me. They just hide it. They pretend that I can just live off the goddamn apocalypse.  I don't wanna live that way. Please, I don't want to die. I'm crying like a baby. Someone, help me.

Triple Threat = biodiversity loss + climate change + overpopulation
[Renewable Energy Charts](https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/57360-2/) — Loki 2020    We started fighting climate change back in 1992 or so.  Since 1992 energy use increased > 50% and greenhouse gases went up 45%.  Electricity is 20% of energy use  in 2020 and will be 24% by 2040.  100% renewable electricity in 2020 = 20% of energy use.  Solar & wind are < 3% of global energy use in 2020.  20% of energy will be renewable by 2040 under ideal conditions.  Battery and wind rare earth demands will cause shortages before 2030.  To delay 1.5 C we have to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years.  China poured more cement in 2 years than the US in 100 years 2017 - 2018.  10 yrs clearing the skies of smog in China raised global north temps 0.1 C.  Renewables will not delay 1.5 C or reduce emission anywhere near 50% in 10 years. Food, water, supply chain shortages and pandemics will severely affect renewables.  Battery and bio-energy extraction destroys global lands, water and wildlife.  We have to double down on extraction from the areas needing protection most.

**Renewable will not stop climate change -- will do more harm than good**    Greenhouse gases went up 45% in 30 years and 350 ppm CO2 will not cool earth, and we will never see that number again, ever.

Why Canada and Europe are Bigger Climate Frauds than Americans
Yanks pump up fresh groundwater, poison it, pump it back underground to frack gas, to burn for electricity to charge their car batteries, in a mega drought; and because of this Yanks cut emissions more switching to gas than Europe did switching to renewables, if you ignore all the leaky wells.

Runic Eco-Terrorism Instruction Manual    This guide is for entertainment purposes only and should not be used for any malicious intent. The aim is to protect natural spaces through psychological and symbolic methods, creating a sense of awe, mystery, and reverence that deters harmful activity.    Step 1: Understand the Power of Runes    Runes are ancient symbols imbued with deep meanings tied to nature, transformation, and protection. When strategically placed, they can invoke a sense of otherworldliness and create a psychological barrier against those who may wish to harm sacred spaces.    Key Runes to Use:  	1.	ᛟ Othala: Heritage, legacy, and ancestral connection. Represents the sacred and eternal importance of the space.  	2.	ᚺ Hagalaz: Transformation, disruption, and the forces of nature. A warning to those who would disrupt the balance.  	3.	ᚦ Thurisaz: Thor’s protection, challenges, and resilience. A symbol of divine guardianship over the space.    Step 2: Gather Your Tools  	•	Knife or Carving Tool: Your “celestial spear.” Ensure it’s sharp, durable, and comfortable to use.  	•	Runic Reference Chart: Keep a guide to runes and their meanings for accuracy.  	•	Gloves: Avoid leaving fingerprints to maintain the mystery.  	•	Flashlight: If working at night for added stealth.  	•	Notebook: Document locations and meanings for your own records.    Step 3: Choose Your Sacred Space  	•	Identify the Area: Look for natural spaces under threat, such as forests, groves, or fields slated for development.  	•	Find Key Spots: Focus on places that are highly visible to visitors or workers, like trees, rocks, or structures near entry points or paths.  	•	Make It Sacred: Treat the space with respect and reverence. Connect with its energy before starting.    Step 4: Carve the Runes  	1.	Choose a Surface: Pick sturdy and conspicuous surfaces like tree trunks, fallen logs, or boulders.  	2.

A systematic exploration of bacterial form I rubisco maximal carboxylation rates | The EMBO Journal
Form I rubisco, known for its slow kinetics in plants and algae, exhibits a great unexplored diversity in autotrophic bacteria. This article represents the first large-scale survey of bacterial form I rubisco kinetics and reveals unifying features of fast carboxylating rubiscos.    Over 100 homologs were systematically screened, spanning the wide genetic diversity of form I rubisco enzymes across a variety of ecological niches and metabolic profiles.    Phototrophy and carboxysome association are correlated with fast-carboxylating rubiscos.    α-cyanobacteria emerges as the bacterial clade expressing the fastest form I rubiscos on Earth.

Climate Engineers of Reddit -  Can AI-Driven Satellite Systems for Climate Control Work? (Concept Paper)
TLDR: Concept paper that explores AI-driven satellite network to reduce wildfire spread by focusing solar energy (visible light or infrared) to heat 100-500 km² areas by 1-3°C, creating high-pressure zones that cut wind speeds by 15-25%.    AI-Driven Satellite Systems for Climate Control: A Novel Approach to Managing Wildfires and Atmospheric Pressure  Author: MGCMD  Date: March 11, 2025    This concept paper proposes an AI-driven satellite network with adaptive optical lenses to focus sunlight, creating localized high-pressure zones that reduce wind speeds by 20-30% during wildfires. Targeting a 1-3°C increase over 10-200 km², the system leverages visible light or infrared (IR) options, compared for efficacy. We assess feasibility, atmospheric response, long-term effects, and risks via an enhanced WRF simulation framework, with plans for empirical validation.    [1. Introduction]    Wildfires, intensified by climate change and extreme winds, pose a growing global threat. The 2020 August Complex fire in California, driven by 50-70 mph winds, burned over 1 million acres, underscoring the limits of traditional methods like controlled burns and firebreaks under high-wind conditions (10-30 m/s). These conditions are common in fire-prone regions such as the Mediterranean, Australia, and western North America.    This concept paper outlines a novel approach: an AI-integrated satellite system to concentrate solar energy—using either visible light or infrared (IR)—to heat targeted atmospheric regions, creating high-pressure zones that reduce wind-driven fire spread. Optimized for areas of 10-200 km², this scalable, reversible system builds on advancements in satellite constellations, AI forecasting, and optical technologies. While scientifically informed, it awaits empirical validation through simulations and prototypes.    [2.

A closer look reveals that the color comes not from condensation, but from something less ephemeral, and whose presence across the country has become the subject of provocative debate. The purple hue comes from lupines densely growing along the hills.

My new video… Methane Hydrate Migration and Venting from Ocean Seafloor Worse than Thought
On coastlines around the Earth, at water depths between 450 and 700 meters the high water pressure and low water temperature allow methane hydrates (methane clathrates) to be stable on the ocean floor. It is estimated that there is about 1,800 GtC stored in these methane hydrates around the planet, with about 3.5% of the total in and around the above methane hydrate stability depth.  As the oceans continue to warm throughout the water column, there is increased risk of thawing many of these hydrates, but much of the methane released at those depths is absorbed within the water column and doesn’t make it into the atmosphere.  Unfortunately, a new peer reviewed study just published online shows that methane released from hydrates at much deeper depths and embedded within the ocean sediments can migrate up to a least 40 km and be released in much shallower depths varying from 300 meter water depth to 100 meters water depth. This methane is derived from the 96.5% methane pool not located near the 450-700 meter depths; and also much of what is released at the shallower depths can make it through the water column into the atmosphere to spike the atmosphere and global temperatures.  Paper: “Long-distance migration and venting of methane from the base of the hydrate stability zone” https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01333-w The paper uses three-dimensional seismic surveys to map the sediments and methane clathrates within off the Mauritanian coast in far-western Africa, however there is nothing unique about methane hydrates in this region. In fact, methane hydrates can be found along coastlines around the planet.  We can easily identify the regions on the ocean floor where there have been sizeable methane eruptions due to the large pockmark features left in the sediments. When a pockmark is on the surface of the ocean floor, we know it is a very recent methane burst. Older methane bursts create pockmarks that become covered by sediments settling down to the ocean fl ... <truncated>

Ice shelf holding back keystone Antarctic glacier within years of failure. A warming ocean is undermining the Thwaites ice shelf.
From the article:   Even more worrisome is the process that has weakened the ice shelf: incursions of warm ocean water beneath the shelf, which expedition scientists detected with a robotic submersible. Because Thwaites sits below sea level on ground that dips away from the coast, the warm water is likely to melt its way inland, beneath the glacier itself, freeing its underbelly from bedrock. A collapse of the entire glacier, which some researchers think is only centuries away, would raise global sea level by 65 centimeters. And because Thwaites occupies a deep basin into which neighboring glaciers would flow, its demise could eventually lead to the loss of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet,

Bottom Crack Study on Antarctica’s Ross Ice Shelf With Underwater Robot Measures Instability
A paper called “Direct Observation of Melting, Freezing, and Ocean Circulation in an Ice Shelf Basal Crevasse” was just published online (open access): https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi7638 This very interesting, and very important study involved hot-water drilling a hole through an ice shelf in the Ross Shelf in Antarctica, and sending a robot called Icefin (follow Icefin on Twitter/X) through the hole to the water cavity near the glacier Grounding Line (GL) in the so-called Grounding Zone (GZ).  This robot surveyed one of the Ice Shelf Basal Crevasses (crack in the ice extending from the bottom partway upwards through the ice shelf). Measurements included three-dimensional water flow rates inside the crevasse, water temperatures, water salinity (thus water density) and detailed visual examination of features inside the crevasse on the walls of the crack.  The physical dynamics of the water flows and melting and crevasse characteristics were measured in detail, to completely characterize the present state of the crack and surrounding conditions within the bottom of the ice shelf. Repeating the study in a year or subsequent years would then allow an understanding of whether or not the ice shelf is at risk of total collapse or if it is fairly stable.  Given the extremely warm anomalies in the oceans around Antarctica and the enormous collapse of Antarctic Sea ice around the continent, it is vital to assess possible ice shelf collapses, due to the associated increase in ice sheet flow into the ocean resulting directly from ice shelf collapses.

Is climate change responsible for the high magnitude of Haiti's recent earthquake(s)?
There are many facts that can lead to that conclusion: *More melted polar ice means more water in the oceans.* *More water in the oceans means more weight on the ocean floors.* *More weight on the ocean floors means it's harder for magma to naturally rise from the ocean floors. Which allows more pressure to build up.* *When you boil water it bubbles.  Put a lid on and it pops off. Put a lid on tightly and KA-BOOM!* Thoughts?

Current state of subsea permafrost in the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian Seas: On the Methane RISK
A new paper by multiple Russian authors, including Shakhova and Semilitov (remember them) came out recently.  Key finding: Sediment temperatures are as high at +5.0 C in large regions.  Methane burst risks… Here are the relevant links: “Abstract Features of sediment temperature on the shelf and continental slope areas of the Russian Arctic seas and its physical properties are important for understanding the current state of subsea permafrost and the gas hydrates stability zone. New data are reported for the Kara Sea region where the bottom sediment temperatures are influenced by warming effects from great Siberian rivers and the Atlantic currents. The data collected during marine expeditions in 2019–2022 are combined with results of earlier marine studies, drilling operations, and geophysical surveys in the Laptev and East Siberian seas, in order to identify major trends of in situ temperature and properties distribution of bottom sediments in the Russian Arctic region. Most (85%) of bottom sediments in the Kara Sea shelf, as well as in the Laptev and East Siberian shelves, consist of water-saturated silty clay and silt with rather uniform particle size distribution. The obtained thermal conductivity and heat capacity values for the Kara Sea sediments agree with the values of 1.0 W/(m·K) and 2900 kJ/m3, respectively, obtained previously from other Arctic seas. Thermal conductivity becomes up to 40% higher depthward from 0 to 2 m subbottom depth, possibly, because of lower moisture content and porosity in more lithified sediments. The bottom sediment temperatures in the Arctic seas are distributed unevenly, especially in the Kara Sea shelf (from +5.0 °C in the west to −1.4 °C in the east), where the high sediment temperatures in the western and central parts of the Kara Sea being due to the effect of warm water inputs. The distribution of bottom sediment temperatures correlates well with distribution of relic subsea permafrost. Ice-bearing permafrost in the Siberian  ... <truncated>

Glacial Retreat of 610 meters (2013 ft) per day occurred in Past, Leaving Corrugated Seafloor Ridges
Who needs to go to a horror movie? Just learn about the very latest cutting edge climate science instead. A very disturbing peer-reviewed scientific paper was just released online (open source, this means it is accessible to all for free). https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05876-1  This paper used high-resolution sonar to map the ocean seafloor on the continental shelves off Norwegian glaciers. During the last ice age, the on-land glaciers expanded far out over the continental shelves, the ice sheets rested on the continental shelf seafloor and then extended outward to floating ice shelves. The Grounding Line is the furthest extent seaward where the ice sheet rests on the ocean floor. The peak of the last ice age, where the glacier extent was maximum was roughly 21,000 years ago. Since then, there was melting and loss of the ice sheets, and therefore retreat of the grounding line. The tides are semi-diurnal off the Norway coast, meaning they cycled from high tide to low tide twice a day (hi-lo-hi-lo each day). At each low, the ice sheet ground into the ocean sediments, leaving a corrugating ridge parallel to the land, so two ridges were imprinted per day at the grounding line as the ice retreated. By simply measuring the distance between the ridges, we know the retreat rates of the ice per day.  This new study examined numerous ridges over a widespread region on the Norwegian continental shelves. The really scary finding is that the ice retreat rate was as high as 610 meters per day (2013 feet per day), and this rate could be maintained for at least 21 days. This rate is much higher than anything previously observed, and thus it means that huge ice sheets can melt much faster than we previously thought, and therefore sea level rise can occur much faster than we think. I’m not surprised, this is all part and parcel of abrupt climate system change. Please donate to http://PaulBeckwith.net to support my research and videos.

Scientists track 'alarming' melt in Antarctic ice shelves
Reuters    >Around 40% of Antarctica's ice shelves have significantly shrunk over the last 25 years, scientists said on Thursday, in findings the European Space Agency said were "alarming".    >    >The melting saw 71 of Antarctica's 162 ice shelves lose mass from 1997 to 2021 - of which 68 posted a "statistically significant" reduction, according to the study published in the journal Science Advances on Thursday.    >    >Scientists said the losses went beyond the ice shelves' normal fluctuations and added to evidence of how human-caused climate change is affecting Antarctica.    Paper is here: Benjamin J. Davison *et al.,* Annual mass budget of Antarctic ice shelves from 1997 to 2021.*Sci. Adv.***9**,eadi0186(2023).DOI:[10.1126/sciadv.adi0186](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi0186)    Abstract:    >Antarctic ice shelves moderate the contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea level rise; however, ice shelf health remains poorly constrained. Here, we present the annual mass budget of all Antarctic ice shelves from 1997 to 2021. Out of 162 ice shelves, 71 lost mass, 29 gained mass, and 62 did not change mass significantly. Of the shelves that lost mass, 68 had statistically significant negative mass trends, 48 lost more than 30% of their initial mass, and basal melting was the dominant contributor to that mass loss at a majority (68%). At many ice shelves, mass losses due to basal melting or iceberg calving were significantly positively correlated with grounding line discharge anomalies; however, the strength and form of this relationship varied substantially between ice shelves. Our results illustrate the utility of partitioning high-resolution ice shelf mass balance observations into its components to quantify the contributors to ice shelf mass change and the response of grounded ice.    &#x200B;

The Australian Academy of Science says the more ambitious target of the Paris Climate Agreement of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees has now slipped out of reach and is “virtually impossible”. “Limiting the temperature rise to the lower Paris Agreement target is exceedingly difficult, and with only three or four more years of emissions at current levels remaining, the target has become virtually impossible to achieve,” says *The Risks to Australia of a 3C Warmer World*. If 1.5 degrees of warming was sustained, the Great Barrier Reef would cease to exist as we know it, says one of the authors, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a biologist and climate scientist specialising in coral reefs."

Why does the 2018 IPCC report on Global Warming of 1.5C project that we'll pass 1.5C in 2040 at our current rate, yet there are many recent news articles & research claiming we will hit 1.5C much sooner?
Text from the [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-1/) summary:    >*Human-induced warming has already reached about* *1°C above pre-industrial levels at the time of writing of this Special Report.* *By the decade 2006–2015, human activity had warmed the world by 0.87°C (±0.12°C) compared to pre-industrial times (1850–1900). If the current warming rate continues, the world would reach human-induced global warming of 1.5°C around 2040.*    An [example of an article](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65602293) claiming researchers are saying the change could happen much sooner:    >Since 2020 the World Meteorological Organisation has been giving an estimate of the chances of the world breaking the 1.5C threshold in any one year. Back then they predicted there was less than a 20% chance of breaking 1.5C in the five years ahead. By last year this had increased to 50%, and now it's jumped to 66%.    It's easy to search for other articles reporting on similar claims/findings. So what's the deal? Have energy needs and emissions increased our "current rate" by that much in the last five years as to expediate warming?

How can warming stop immediately if we hit net zero tomorrow, despite the well-known lag between emissions and warming?
Stefan Ramström said on Nate Hagens' podcast that if emissions hit net zero tomorrow, warming would immediately stop.

UNFCCC first "Global Stocktake"
The UNFCCC released the first "Global Stocktake" climate report yesterday. The report is a check-in on what countries have collectively done, so far, eight years after the Paris Agreement. It is a bit like an inventory on countries' collective climate action (or rather the lack thereof). The report - which was two years in the making - is the most comprehensive assessment of the Paris Agreement to date. As expected the report contains no good news: "The window to keep limiting warming to 1.5C within reach is closing rapidly, and progress is still inadequate based on the best available science." (para 80) The report further notes that emissions need to fall by another 43% by 2030 (against 2019 levels) if we want to have a reasonable chance to achieve 1.5C (para 13).

So, I came across this [(map)](https://twitter.com/hannahker11/status/1329163888680706050?s=20) by Hannah Ker based up the [(data set)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/lulc-human-modification-terrestrial-systems)... which made me think...what are the possible solution to this?    Increase population density, to the point where humans are interacting with less than 1% of overall landmass. That would allow nature to rebuild itself, with a little help, replanting and what not. While maintaining a decent quality of life, for humans ...    In order to accomplish this...we would require 100 cities with 100 million people each, with a population density between Manhattan and Tokyo - vertical factory farming, hydroponic farming, aeroponic farming, and fish farming, desalination, free efficient public transportation, powered by renewable energy and nuclear…connected by hyperloops or bullet trains.    This will take time and stages....So, the first two cities to be built would be connecting Sudan or Somalia, to Mauritania or Western Sahara, via hyperloop. This is mostly for freight not people. Allowing shipping companies a cheaper alterative to the suez canal or horn of africa, while reducing the pollution. The hyperloop would require solar on top, and trees to be planted on either side in order to reduce damage from sand, this also creates carbon sink.    Those first two cities and next 30-40 Cities would allow us to raise, 3-4 billion people out of extreme poverty while reducing their overall carbon, pollution, and impact on environment. building these cities it allows us to better organize, maintain, and redevelop key infrastructure for recycling, sewage treatment, and trash.

Banning private jets possibly disrupting regular flights
TL;DR: If celebrities took commercial flights, there would likely be widespread harassments by erratic fans, causing delays and safety issues.    Don't get me wrong, private jets should absolutely be one of the first things to go. They are the most polluting form of transportation only done by the mega rich, and there are so many viable "greener" alternatives, like commercial flights or just riding in a chauffeured car, since most private flights are extremely short anyway.    However, I can't help but feel like forcing well-known celebrities to take commercial flights will invite rabid fans and bad actors to take advantage of it. Especially with the lack of common sense these days.    I know private terminals and car transfers to and from gates and whatnot exist, so we likely wouldn't see too much of this in the airport terminal, but once people get on the plane and whispers start circling that Taylor Swift is in seat 1A things aren't going to end well.    People pushing their way through the aisle to get an autograph, arguing with the flight attendant when they say that you can't go on the other side of that curtain to see them, refusing even to sit down when the seatbelt sign is on. This will cause tons of security threats, delays, cancelations, flight diversions, you name it for the rest of us. Not to mention the possibility of things getting physical with staff or other passengers, potentially hurting other people nearby in the confined plane, or passengers standing up during turbulence and becoming projectiles.    We could put enclosed suites with restrooms on every plane specifically for celebrities and board in such a way where they can enter incognito, but most of the time they will just have to give it away to some status member as an upgrade. There likely won't be demand for a suite every day on your average American Airlines flight from Phoenix to Miami. That's a waste of valuable space and thus emissions.    Is there anything else we can do about it? Or ... <truncated>

Lightning Strikes Greatly Increased in Proximity of Global Shipping Routes: Aerosols and ship metal… Lightning is 15× (66x) more likely to occur at a ship location compared to 2 km (25 km) away.
I was browsing Twitter/X to see American Geophysical Union scientific talks (AGU23 just ended last week, in San Francisco with 27,000 scientists attending) and I came across the following neat topic: Press: https://eos.org/articles/ocean-vessels-may-trigger-lightning-strikes Open-Source Paper: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EA002926 Amazingly: Lightning is 15× more likely to occur at a ship location compared to 2 km away.  Lightning is 66× more likely to occur at a ship location compared to 25 km away.  Some ships seem to attract huge numbers of lightning strikes compared to others. For example: “The vessel with the most lightning encounters was the Shelby Courtney, which operates around Gulf Coast Louisiana and was within 2 km of 449 WWLLN strokes during the 3-year period. The second vessel by stroke count is the 187 m cargo ship Bahama Spirit with 444 close lightning encounters. Cargo and tanker ships account for 5 of the top 25 vessels in Table 1, while there are also 3 tugs, 1 dredger, and 1 fishing boat. There are no pleasure craft or sailing ships in Table 1, but the top 25 ships by close lightning encounters do include 3 cruise ships: the Disney Dream with 413 strokes, the Disney Fantasy with 290 strokes, and the Carnival Pride with 270 strokes. The variety of vessel sizes and categories in Table 1 suggests that the amount of time spent sailing in lightning-prone regions is the primary driver of close lightning encounters. All of these vessels spent hundreds of days at sea over the 3-year period, and the hundreds of WWLLN matches only account for less than 0.3% of the AIS data generated by each vessel.” Cool website in lightning strikes around the planet: World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN): https://wwlln.net/ Global Ship Tracking website: https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-12.0/centery:25.0/zoom:4 Please donate to http://paulbeckwith.net to support my research and videos as I join the dots on abrupt climate  ... <truncated>

Private Jet Use Is Soaring - And The U.S. Is Responsible For The Most Flights
Of the 20 airports in the world that see the most private jet flights, 18 are in the U.S.    The U.S. is so flush with private jets that Florida and Texas together were the source of more private jet flights and greenhouse gas emissions than the entire European Union.

Population Density? - To save the World?
So, reading an came across this [(map)](https://twitter.com/hannahker11/status/1329163888680706050?s=20)by Hannah Ker based up the [(data set)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/lulc-human-modification-terrestrial-systems)... which made me think...what are the possible solution to this?    So first thought, kill 6 billion of the 7 billion...but I find that morally out of my comfort zone ... and If I am being honest I do not have enough to offer the world, so I would be in that 6 billion....    So, a few shitty ideas later.....I had a less shitty idea...    **Increase population density, to the point where humans are interacting with less than 1% of overall landmass.**  That would allow nature to rebuild itself, with a little help, replanting and what not.  While maintaining a decent quality of life, for humans ...    In order to accomplish this...we would require **100 cities with 100 million people each**, with a population density between Manhattan and Tokyo -  vertical factory farming, hydroponic farming, aeroponic farming, and fish farming, desalination, free efficient public transportation, powered by renewable energy and nuclear…connected by hyperloops or bullet trains.    This will take time and stages....So, the first two cities to be built would be connecting Sudan or Somalia, to Mauritania or Western Sahara, via hyperloop. This is mostly for freight not people. Allowing shipping companies a cheaper alterative to the suez canal or horn of africa, while reducing the pollution. The hyperloop would require solar on top, and trees to be planted on either side in order to reduce damage from sand, this also creates carbon sink.    Those first two cities and next 30-40 Cities would allow us to raise, 3-4 billion people out of extreme poverty while reducing their overall carbon, pollution, and impact on environment. building these cities it allows us to better organize, maintain, and redevelop key infrastructure for recycling, sewage treatment, and trash.  ... <truncated>

The amount of CO2 humans produce per year is the equivalent of a 24 story high being 747 engine running at takeoff speed which spews out only CO2, running 24/7
If the estimates are correct and we produce 37.12 billion metric tons of CO2 per year, then the match works out to a roughly 244 foot tall jet engine just freaking BLASTING out only CO2. All day, every day.    37,120,000,000,000 kg/year    1,177,067 kg/sec    Jet engine consumes roughly 1100 kg/second of air at takeoff. If the jet engine is 93.4 inches in diameter, the jet engine expels 1100 kg/second in 47 square feet, which is 25 kg/second/square foot.    Working backwards now, it would take a jet engine with 47,082 square feet of area at 25 kg/second to equal our CO2output. That square footage equals a jet engine roughly 244 feet across.     Sometimes its easier to understand the enormity of something when its mathed down to something we actually get.

Should Americans actually be blamed for not riding trains if there are no viable trains to take?
This post is referring more to intercity service (i.e. Amtrak) as an alternative to flights and road travel, but this largely applies to regional transit like subways, light rail, commuter rail, even rapid bus service, etc. as well.    Sure, there's absolutely tons of totally unnecessary air travel happening in the U.S. There are 14 flights a day between the Miami area and Orlando, including on low cost carriers that probably don't have many connecting passengers, despite the existence of Brightline. It's more comfortable, cheaper (especially after airline fees), and only about 30 minutes slower door to door. Same likely goes for some city pairings on the Acela Express corridor.    People just see a cheap 1 hour flight and assume it's the default way to travel without considering the cost to our planet, let alone the hidden time and money sinks that air travel creates (bag fees, getting there 2 hours early, etc.) compared to alternatives.    However in most areas of the U.S., this is not the case. Amtrak usually takes longer than even driving, and is rampant with multiple hour delays for freight trains, power outages, understocked cafe cars, dirty trains, passengers that weren't acting very safe, and more. I've encountered all of these in just 4 10-hour Amtrak rides.    Even if you are fortunate enough to have the vacation time to regularly travel by train (which in the U.S. job market is unlikely), you are probably going to be traveling on an old diesel train that isn't operating at full capacity. There won't nearly be as much emission savings as in other countries.    And it's not like these are extravagant international trips either. Most of it is work trips, visiting family and friends, or just visiting nature, events, cities, and attractions all within our own country (which we should be doing more of to minimize overtourism impacts). The U.S. just happens to be a large country that requires a 6 hour flight to cross (excluding Hawaii since there's also ethical  ... <truncated>

Distraught about Flight Reductions
I travel for business - typically 7 transoceanic flights per year. Last year I reduced it as much as I could - down to 3. Even then I blamed my employer - “I HAD to go...”    I feel like I should have a little less guilt, but those planes still took off. In order for an airline to cancel a route, it would have to become unprofitable - and that would take a LOT more people than just me.    Recently I wanted to take a weekend getaway to a nearby city and looked into alternatives.    Mode of transport	Round trip cost One way time Flying (economy)	$150	1.5 hours Driving	$120	11 hours Train (economy)	$200	9 hours Train (sleeper cabin) $400	9 hours    My partner asked me how much quality of life I was willing to give up to avoid flying - especially since those planes are still going to take off with or without us. And I see her point... will we never travel outside our city again?    I’m struggling with doing my part without thinking too extreme and without becoming too much of a hypocrite.

La psicologia del cambio climatico
Desde hace muchos años el cambio climático dejo de ser una amenaza para convertirse en una realidad abrumadora, si continuamos dañando el planeta de la manera tan acelerada en la que lo hacemos, pronto las consecuencias serán irreversibles; Con el paso del tiempo, se le ha dado más difusión a este tema, los gobiernos comienzan a dejar sus diferencias y comienzan a unirse para contrarrestar las consecuencias ya existentes de este fenómeno natural causado por el hombre, la comunidad científica de todo el mundo está trabajando mano a mano para encontrar soluciones rápidas debido a que queda poco tiempo que perder    &#x200B;    Una de las mayores promesas en contra de la contaminación ambiental es que poco a poco iremos cambiando la materia prima con la que el mundo funciona, es decir dejaremos de utilizar los combustibles fósiles como fuente de energía; prácticamente todo lo creado por el hombre tiene una huella de carbono debido a que estos productos son derivados o tienen que ver indirectamente con los gases de efecto invernadero, la premisa es que al cambiar la materia prima con la que están hechos: los coches, las carreteras, los anillos de matrimonio, la ropa, los recipientes de cocina y una infinidad de productos mas se estaría dejando de contaminar al planeta, puesto que la materia prima con la que están hechas dichas cosas ya no vendrían de los combustibles fósiles sino vendrían de recursos naturales como el sol, el agua, y el viento, pero esto será realmente cierto? ¿Será posible que si cambiamos el proceso y la materia prima de donde salen todos los materiales usados por el hombre será el fin de la crisis climática?

Hice un artículo escolar dirigido al cambio climático. Me gustaría un poco de feedback si es posible :) # El Cambio Climático    El cambio climatico es uno de los temas mas importantes y preocupantes que enfrenta la humanidad en la actualidad. Pero, qué significa realmente este termino y como impacta en nuestras vidas diarias?        En resumen, el cambio climático se refiere a los cambios grandes y duraderos en los patrones climaticos de la Tierra. Estos cambios pueden ser de diferentes formas, como el aumento de las temperaturas globales, cambios en los patrones de lluvia y el aumento de fenómenos como huracanes y sequias.        Una de las principales causas del cambio climático es la actividad humana, principalmentee la emisión de gases como el dióxido de carbono (CO2) y el metano (CH4). Estos gases atrapan el calor en la atmósfera, creando un aumento en la temperatura global, conocido como calentamiento global.        Los efectos del cambio climático se sienten en todo el mundo y pueden tener problemas grandes para el medio ambiente y la sociedad. Por ejemplo, el derretimiento de los glaciares y los casquetes polares está contribuyendo al aumento del nivel del mar, amenazando a las comunidades que viven en la costa y a la gran cantidad de animales marinos.        Además, el cambio climático puede tener impactos en la seguridad alimentaria, la salud pública y la economía global. Las sequías y las inundaciones pueden afectar la producción agrícola, mientras que el aumento de las temperaturas puede aumentar el riesgo de enfermedades transmitidas por vectores como el dengue y la malaria.        Es importante destacar que el cambio climatico no es un problema futuro, sino una realidad que ya estamos pasando. Sin embargo, aun hay esperanza. Tommando medidas para reducir nuestras emisiones de gases y adaptarnos a los cambios climáticos, podemos disminuir los impactos del cambio climático y construir un futuro más seguro para todos.        En conclusión, el cambio climático es un problema global que requiere acción y rapido. Al comprender sus causas y efectos, podemos to ... <truncated>

You can protect yourself from COVID-19 by injecting, swallowing, bathing in or rubbing onto your body.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      **The answer is False**.These products are highly toxic and should never be swallowed or injected into the body. Call 911 if this occurs. Disinfectants, bleach and soap and water may be used to clean surfaces, an important prevention step in stopping the spread of coronavirus and COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus that’s led to the global pandemic. Never attempt to self-treat or prevent COVID-19 by rubbing or bathing with bleach, disinfectants or rubbing alcohol anywhere on your body. Effective hand sanitizers do have alcohol, but they are formulated to be safe for use on hands.  2. **TRUE or FALSE? A vaccine to cure COVID-19 is available.**                                                                    **The answer is False.** There is no vaccine for the new coronavirus right now. Scientists have already begun working on one, but developing a vaccine that is safe and effective in human beings will take many months or years.  3. **TRUE or FALSE? Ordering or buying products shipped from overseas will make a person sick.**                                                                                                                                                                    **The answer is False.** Researchers are studying the new coronavirus to learn more about how it infects people.

Greg’s Last Fist Bump
So I chatted with ChatGPT a bit today and had the idea of turning carbon back into oil and pumping it back down again where it came from    So my idea was that an ancient civilisation already did so and then said;    “You know what. That’s perfect. No one will ever be insane enough to touch that crap.    Let’s go for a beer guys.”    And he turned that into a story    And I’m not sure it that content is ok here or it is the wrong sub or against the rules, but that’s the little story we came up with;    Please feel free to delete it if it isn’t the right place here, hopefully you can enjoy;    - - -    Millions of years ago, deep beneath the Earth’s surface, a council gathered. Wise beyond measure, they sealed away the planet’s lifeblood — black, sticky, repulsive carbon — locked tight in caverns far below. They laughed as they finished their work.    “Perfect,” said Greg, wiping soot from his hands. “No one sane will ever touch this stuff again.”    “Exactly,” replied the others, raising their glasses. “We’ve engineered the ultimate warning. The stink, the mess, the ugliness — foolproof!”    And so they left it to slumber beneath the soil, a warning etched not in words but in nature’s own repellent signature.    ⸻    Fast forward eons.    A young, desperate species stumbles upon the forbidden goo. Drawn by hunger and power, they pull it from the ground, ignoring the silent warnings encoded in its very essence.    The planet heats, the skies burn, and the ancient warning grows louder in retrospect.    ⸻    But then comes a new Greg — one who understands the cost. With trembling hands and hopeful heart, he commands the lifeblood to flow back into the earth. The black goo returns home, recycled by hands powered not by greed, but by clean energy and care.    He turns to his comrades and smiles.    “Now it’s foolproof. No one will ever be insane enough to touch this again.”    And they fist bump, hopeful their folly is behind them.    —    But millions of years later, fa ... <truncated>

SAND FROM SAHARA CAUSING AIR POLLUTION IN EUROPE
Recently, European levels of air pollution have [risen dramatically](https://www.euronews.com/2021/02/09/sahara-sand-causes-air-pollution-spike-in-europe-turning-skies-and-snow-orange), as a result of dust from sand in the Sahara. To protect yourself and your families, you should be aware of the risks posed by this type of air pollution, and understand the best measures that can limit any associated health risks.    In this blog post, we will be explaining this recent development, detailing the areas affected, and providing our advice on how you can minimize the impact that this type of air pollution has on your health.    # WHAT AREAS ARE AFFECTED?    In countries across Southern and Central parts of Europe, a cloud which is made up of fine sand particles has drifted from the [Sahara desert](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sahara-desert-Africa) (located in Algeria) in such a volume that a spike in air pollution levels has been recorded.    This increased volume of air pollution was picked up by the Copernicus satellite monitoring programme of The European Commission. The intention behind this programme is to track levels of harmful particulate matter in the air.    Due to a significant increase in [PM10](https://cambridgemask.com/blogs/news/learn-about-pm10), that has been caused by these sand particles, in some countries, the sky has turned colour, to a dusky orange, or even red in some cases. This sighting was particularly prominent in the high, normally bright and clear skies of European mountains including the Alps and the Pyrenees. In these areas, the ski slopes had the appearance of looking orange, as the snow reflected the ominous colour in the sky.    Other areas in which a spike in PM10 was recorded included cities like Barcelona, Lyon, and Marseille, as Spain and France are two countries which have been particularly hit by this air pollution.    # WHAT IS CAUSING THE AIR POLLUTION?

The worldwide outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) prompted many to purchase face masks for protection. Unfortunately, these protective masks have been harming the environment. Why is that? The masks are made of the plastic polypropylene, which is not easily biodegradable. No surprise then that the accumulation of discarded face masks litters the environment and poses serious risks to the equilibrium of habitats and the health of wildlife, especially marine organisms.

Would Trump Scrap Plans to End Old-Growth Logging Next Year?
Less than two weeks before the election, the future of logging remains a hot-button political issue, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump clashing over how old-growth forests should be managed.    It comes as Republicans have vowed to repeal President Biden’s signature climate change law, which passed Congress without a single Republican in favour, with GOP leaders promising to repel it if Trump wins the election – who now leads Harris 51/49 according to election aggregator Five-Thirty-Eight.    In recent months, House Republicans and House Democrats have clashed on logging, with President Biden, in June, promising to “effectively halt all logging in old-growth forests” after his administration published a plan, which, if Harris is elected, will apply to more than 32 million acres of forests managed by the US Forest Service and the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management.

Researchers investigate resistance and recovery of Coral Reef
Reef-forming corals are struggling in warming oceans. Temperatures as little as 1 degree Celsius above normal are stressful for the delicate symbiotic relationship between corals and the tiny algae that feed them, remove their waste, and enable their beautiful colors. Heat stress can lead those algal partners to abandon their coral homes, a phenomenon called bleaching because it leaves reefs a ghostly white. Bleaching events are becoming increasingly common and prolonged. An estimated 94% of coral reefs have already experienced one or more episodes of severe coral bleaching since 1980 as a result of record-breaking temperature extremes.  “We found some types of corals that recovered from bleaching and healed themselves while they were still exposed to high temperatures,” says Baum. Coral recovery from bleaching had previously been observed only after heat stress subsidence. Their discovery, published in 2020 in Nature Communications, was “a game-changer,” says Baum. It underlined the volumes still to be learned about coral resilience.

Coral bleaching is worse than you thought:
This issue has been causing concern among marine scientists and environmentalists, so let's dive into what's happening and why it matters.    **What is Coral Bleaching?**  Coral bleaching is a phenomenon where coral reefs lose their vibrant colors due to the expulsion of symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. These algae provide the coral with nutrients and give them their beautiful hues. When stressed by various factors, such as temperature increase or pollution, corals expel these algae, causing the coral to turn white or "bleach."    **Why is it Happening in Florida?**  The primary driver of coral bleaching in Florida is elevated sea temperatures. Coral reefs are highly sensitive to changes in temperature, and when the water gets too warm, the corals expel their algae, leaving them vulnerable and stressed. Climate change, fueled by greenhouse gas emissions, is causing sea temperatures to rise globally, including in Florida's waters.    **Consequences of Coral Bleaching:**  1. **Biodiversity Loss:** Coral reefs support an incredible diversity of marine life. When corals bleach, it disrupts the entire ecosystem, leading to the loss of habitat and impacting fish and other species that rely on these reefs.    2. **Economic Impact:** Florida's economy heavily depends on tourism and fisheries associated with healthy coral reefs. Coral bleaching threatens these industries and the livelihoods of many who depend on them.    **What Can We Do?**  1. **Reducing Emissions:** Addressing the root cause of coral bleaching requires global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Support policies and practices that promote clean energy and sustainable living.    2. **Responsible Tourism:** If you visit coral reefs in Florida or any other location, practice responsible tourism. Avoid touching or damaging the coral, and choose eco-friendly tour operators.    3. **Support Conservation:** Many organizations are working to protect and restore coral reefs.

Feral horses are destroying Australia's alpine regions. Our wildlife needs your support!
Good afternoon,    Feral horses are further endangering a myriad of species and are devastating for our alpine ecosystems. This [post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/191099460990243/permalink/2515734005193432) from an Australian alpine and reptile ecologist is not perfect but sums up the issue nicely.

The ethics of climate change (environmental ethics)
I've been looking for discussion on environmental ethics, but I haven't much seen any. I haven't really read much on the topic myself, but I think it's a very interesting and important topic, also from the POV of climate change. How do people here reason about environmental ethics? A paper I just read discusses environmental ethics and different aspects of it, among those anthropocentrism and eco/biocentrism. A lot of the contents appear to favor moral relativism, which I agree with. I think many who voice strong opinions on the subject seem to hold fairly strong/absolute moral positions.

Should the Belief that Carbon Dioxide is the cause of Climate Change be Classified as a Religion?
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy provides a definition of religion:      “A religion involves a **communal, transmittable body of teachings and prescribed practices about an ultimate, sacred reality or state of being that calls for reverence or awe**, a body which guides its practitioners into what it describes as a saving, illuminating or emancipatory relationship to this reality through a personally transformative life of prayer, ritualized meditation, and/or moral practices like repentance and personal regeneration.”         Applying these characteristics to proponents of CO2 as the dominate reason for climate change finds striking similarities to a religion.    A. A religion involves a **communal, transmittable body of teachings and prescribed practices about an ultimate, sacred reality or state of being --**    **Carbon Dioxide is the control nob for climate if you follow the science and 97% of climate scientists agree.**    **B.  that calls for reverence or awe --**     Carbon Dioxide has the power to overwhelm the effect of Water Vapor, a more effective more common greenhouse gas    C. a body which guides its practitioners into what it describes as a saving, illuminating or emancipatory relationship to this reality --    Those who disagree with the science or the data are deemed Climate Deniers and Flat Earthers.  Members denigrate opponents as dumb and motivated by money and otherwise having bad motives.    D.  through a personally transformative life of prayer, ritualized meditation, and/or moral practices like repentance and personal regeneration.--    Net Zero is the path to salvation through the use of renewable energy.  Awareness of my carbon footprint signals my need for repentance.  Truly devout members adopt lifestyle changes like veganism.

The reasons why climate change is not a problem...
Even if we consider the possibility that man's activities contribute to the potential climate change it still is not what we would define as a problem.  People often confuse symptoms and problems.  A symptom is something that is underlying observable phenomenon.  Unfortunately the possibility of the economic and population based implications on the disturbance of the ecologic balance become even more frightening than just labeling and pointing and saying there's a problem.  If there is a symptom and people truly believe... One would expect Palestinian style action... Yet no one is making himself a martyr.  Curious, no?  The learned would be expected to take action and perhaps concoct pandemics and genetic solutions to the weighty symptoms disguised as problems.  Perhaps Fauci is to the world what Timothy McVeigh is to freedom and the American way.  A misunderstood freedom fighter...

The biggest problem that I can see
We are terrible at acknowledging our responsibility (that I objectively perceive and project) to the whole. I feel like its something that is very prevalent in our species and is derived from our innate inability to measure things objectively.      Climate change is the shining example to me. I hear and say it all the time,     "Everyone else is doing it, how would my decision make a difference?"    It's an easy idea for me to bite into. It tastes sweet and easy.     But it violates a principle that I hold regardless of whether or not I want to. I believe that we have to be tackling climate change on a systemic and personal level with extreme tenacity, and that personal actions create ripples in society as well. I also believe that we don't deserve to be conscious, and the idea that human life is more important than any other form of life is absurd, and we should be using the fact that we have stumbled upon consciousness to be stewards to the environment, live simply, and live in love.     But I STILL tell myself this lie all the time.     (I acknowledge that many people are in positions that prevents them from worrying about these types of things -- I am privileged enough to not be as focused on the necessities and so I often feel deeper responsibilities to the world)    I would love any thoughts on this human imperfection in general.    Edit: clarity in first statement.

The time of cleansing is now
We take from her, collectively, the whole human race as we drain her, feast upon her sacred flesh like parasites. Not because we are evil, or sinful, but because we just don't know when to stop.  We can't really, we don't know how. It's actually very sad, our industrial society only knew itself, the endless need and desire for consumption (I'm not an exception to this.) We took from her, poisoned her soil, she the mother of all of us, the mother of all life! We can't be allowed to continue like this! She must purge us from her sacred body; it's a sad but necessary cleanse. In order for the planet, for the body to survive she must shake us off from her back. It's not a question of good or evil, of right people or wrong people. It's just a matter of natural cause and effect. Action and consequence.     We knew only ourselves, measured our accomplishments in the comparisons we made with each other. Our rulers are brutal, controlling us through fear and intimidation, through manipulation and greed, they think they're all so strong. These politicians and CEOS, but their wealth means nothing, it's all just words in the end. The goddess doesn't care about that at all. She doesn't even hate us; she mourns her actions just as she will wash us away from her sacred body. But it's something to feel thankful for sadly, our society must be destroyed so life on earth can continue. It is all pattern imo. First, we grow, then we stumble, and only after the cleanse will we be able to truly learn her sacred teachings. And understand who we really are, we are parts of a whole, cogs in a magnificent system, we live in the balance of life, and we are not exceptions to that balance.     Through the small death of our way of life we will be granted a unique opportunity, the opportunity for true evolution! We could grow to utilize this ability to reason in a complex way, what we might call our sentience or consciousness to become more then animal. It all comes down to a primal animal nature ... <truncated>

Ecology is emotional too
We know about ecology, its relationship between living beings and their habitat. However, studies show that ecology is also emotional and is known as an expression that refers to fundamental aspects for a healthy life in harmony with oneself and with the environment, says Gustavo Copelmayer. He adds that we owe this term to Mercè Conangla and Jaume Soler, experts in humanistic psychology and emotional management, who point out that emotional ecology allows us to manage our feelings by channeling energy to build a happy and sustainable life in a creative or unique way.    Emotional ecology is based on different principles, all of which tend to create a responsible conscience towards oneself and towards what surrounds us. Gustavo Copelmayer says that among the principles on which it’s based is freedom, responsibility, respect, prevention and the principle of conservation as an alternative related to regeneration.    An interesting way of being in the world or better stated, of living on this planet, is undoubtedly co-existence. A big mistake has been to believe that humanity could live disconnected from the rest of living beings, because quite the contrary, in addition to our social aspect, we are part of a natural ecosystem and we owe so much to it.    "Mind and emotion work together to guide our actions in order to improve as individuals but also as members of social systems", says Gustavo Copelmayer. In this way, the value ​​of responsibility is as important as that of awareness of the global emotional impact on the environment.

The fundamental challenge in facing climate change that has to be talked about more openly.
I don’t see how we can tackle climate change without either taking extremely drastic and ethically horrific measures or being so slow and methodical that we use up time we may not have.    If we try to solve the problem while clinging to our quality of life, wealth, and freedoms such as the right to travel, drive, eat what we want, and consume as we please, progress may be far too slow. But I can’t see any alternative that doesn’t involve questionable and morally fraught actions, whether that means drastically lowering the global standard of living (which in many places is already poor) for a long time, or massively reducing the population or its growth, both of which are dangerous and obviously unethical.    And if we take the drastic route, who would be in charge of enforcing it? It certainly wouldn’t be the general public, since people are not going to vote to have their way of life destroyed and their living standards reduced to those of the 1600s. It would have to be driven by wealthy elites, politicians, and non-government organizations imposing their vision on the world without democratic consent.    The ethical problems with this are enormous. Who gets to decide what sacrifices are made? And are the people in power even ethical or competent enough to wield such influence responsibly?    Would the elites imposing these measures make the same sacrifices, or would they continue living in luxury while forcing the masses to bear the brunt of the changes?    Could governments exploit the climate crisis to justify authoritarian control, using it as a pretext for surveillance, restrictions, and population control?

Any experienced software programmers interested in a brainstorm session re this "mother of all challenges, how to achieve the highest best use of technology?"
Any experienced software programmers interested in a brainstorm session re this "mother of all challenges, how to achieve the highest best use of technology?"    The historical research of Chenoweth, Zunes,  and others clearly demonstrates that if there is to be any realistic chance for the sorts of systemic changes urgently needed to save what is still savable of Mother Nature and democracy, at least 2.5-3.5% of the population will need to have the moral courage to engage in the strategy of nonviolent civil resistance. This strategy has been essential for virtually all the most significant positive socio-economic-political changes of the past 130years in the US and EU.  There are campaign organizing apps and platforms out there (twitter, facebook, ActionNetwork, Mobilize etc) but none that provide the emotional and social support that really activates and organizes people to the level they need to be activated, what I and probably most organizers would call the "mother of all organizing challenges."  So the question is how might this be done? How can technology help move concerned individuals to commit to such courageous actions (eg sit-ins, strikes, lengthy targeted vigils, and any of the. more than 198 nonviolent direct action tactics).  Certainly electoral activism is a sine qua non. But we should never forget that with a far more Democratically controlled Congress than we have today, and FDR, and a Democratic Socialist Sec of Labor, it still took more than 4000 strikes from 1933-37 including the real threat of a general strike to shut down the entire economy, to pass the New Deal. Most philosophers of ethics and theologians agree that moral courage is the most important of all virtues. Maya Angelou, the great poet put it this way: ""Without courage we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can’t be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.”  So other than perhaps the tech required for vaccination breakthroughs, might there be any higher, better, ... <truncated>

Humans live under the illusion
Humans live under the illusion that the universe is somehow designed to protect and prioritize them. They believe Jupiter deflects asteroids because it’s "meant" to save them, or that the Sun shields Earth from cosmic rays out of some cosmic duty to humanity. But the brutal truth is, the universe doesn’t care. The planets, the stars, the forces of nature—they operate on their own terms, indifferent to whether humans thrive or vanish.    Humans are just another species on a planet that has seen countless others rise and fall. Every day, thousands of species go extinct, yet humanity clings to the delusion that it is unique and indispensable. This ego blinds us to the reality: we are not special, and the universe owes us nothing. It doesn’t exist to save us. Our intelligence, which we pride ourselves on, has become a double-edged sword—fueling our consumption, destruction, and entitlement while ignoring the simplest truth: we are fragile, temporary, and utterly insignificant on the cosmic scale.    If humans continue to act as though they are the center of the universe, consuming and destroying with no regard for the consequences, they will share the same fate as the countless species that have gone extinct before them. The Earth will continue without us. The universe will move on, unbothered. The question is not whether we are important to the universe—it’s whether we are smart enough to recognize our place in it and change our ways before it’s too late.

Here’s the description:    “Join Indigo Rumblelow, one of the key organizers for Just Stop Oil : the British resistance group which has recently won their demand of the UK government to stop licensing new fossil fuels, as she talks about how they did it and how to build a resistance movement which can win demands of the government and transform society here in America.    You will also hear about a new resistance group called Last Generation America which has the following 3 demands of the US government:     1) End fossil fuels : Sign the Fossil Fuel Nonproliferation Treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030.   2) End genocide and our imperialist wars : Place a 2-way arms embargo on both Israel and Ukraine.   3) Make the rich pay : Set a 95% income tax rate for the wealthiest, using the money to end homelessness, hunger and poverty in the US and to pay for a green transition.    You will get information about an upcoming protest we're organizing to make our demands known.”

COP 29 : Les désaccords éclatent dès le premier jour – où va-t-on ?
Salut tout le monde ! La COP 29 vient de débuter en Azerbaïdjan, et déjà, ça commence fort. Les premiers échanges montrent des tensions entre les pays autour des engagements climatiques. Les promesses sont discutées, mais les désaccords semblent aussi gros que l'urgence climatique elle-même... J'ai analysé cette première journée sur ma chaîne YouTube. On y parle des prises de position de chaque bloc de pays, de ce qui bloque vraiment les avancées et de ce que cela peut signifier pour la lutte contre le changement climatique. Si ça vous intéresse, je vous invite à regarder et à partager vos impressions.  Vos avis m'intéressent aussi ! Pensez-vous qu'on va enfin voir des résultats concrets, ou que cette COP sera juste une autre suite de promesses sans actes ? 🤔

Environment And Collaboration Repost
Hello everyone on [r/environment](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/)! This is my second post on Reddit, though I have been a lurker on the platform for some time now. I am a senior student engaging in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The Anthropology course within the program requires me to conduct anthropological research as part of my Individual Assessment (IA). I have chosen this subreddit to engage with because I am very interested in environmental conservation and I would like to see the opinions of this issue from people who actively choose to partake in environmental discussion.    My two methods of research will be survey and interview: i have prepared a short, 4-question Google Form which will be linked below. I wish to make it fully apparent that the research gathered will be used for the report I will write on this topic. According to the research ethics of anthropology (as it was taught in my course), individuals under the age of 18 are disallowed to engage in anthropological research without parental consent. If you are under this threshold and still wish to respond, please privately message me with a voice recording of your parent/guardian allowing you to do so.    For those interested in having further discussion on the topic, I encourage you to privately message me so we may conduct a 10-minute interview. For the sake of comfort and more accessible evidence, I ask that we keep the interview in a text-only format.    I very much appreciate your time in reading this post, engaging with the survey and possibly engaging in an interview. The Google Form is open, linked below. Thank you so much.

Hello everyone! I’m currently writing my university dissertation on online political advocacy and am hoping to do some qualitative research. My thesis aims to look at the rise of online petitions and the motivations/ experiences of those who sign them.    If you have signed a petition in the last 2 months, and have a spare 25-30 minuets to chat about that experience, I’d love to hear from you! I am more than happy to pay £20 or so (sorry I’m a broke student) to anyone who can spare the time. Preferably, you’d be a frequent signee of petitions and post them to your social media pages, although that is not a dealbreaker.    If this interests you, please message me and include some brief details about what the petition was about and where you signed. Hope this is okay to post, thank you!

Understanding the Weather in UK: A guide for your knowledge
The weather in the UK is affected by a number of factors. One of the most important is its location. The UK is located in the North Atlantic and is heavily affected by ocean currents and wind. For example, warm waters from the Gulf Stream help to keep temperatures down, especially in the west of the country. The UK’s position also affects the strength of the jet stream. This jet stream is a narrow, fast-flowing air stream high in the atmosphere. It is responsible for steering weather systems from the Atlantic to the continent. Its strength can decide whether the UK gets mild, wet weather or drier, wetter weather.

For example, warm waters from the Gulf Stream help to keep temperatures down, especially in the west of the country.    The UK’s position also affects the strength of the jet stream. This jet stream is a narrow, fast-flowing air stream high in the atmosphere. It is responsible for steering weather systems from the Atlantic to the continent. Its strength can decide whether the UK gets mild, wet weather or drier, wetter weather.

How melting Arctic ice leads to European drought and heatwaves
"She [Oltmanns] said warmth over Greenland in the summer of 2023 melted a lot of ice, sending more freshwater toward the North Atlantic. Depending on the exact path of the influx, the findings suggest that, in addition to the immediate impacts this year, it will also trigger a heatwave and drought in Northern Europe in a more delayed reaction in the next five years, she said.    The coming extremes will probably be similar to the European heatwaves of 2018 and 2022, she added, when there were huge temperature spikes in the Scandinavian and Siberian Arctic, as well as unusual wildfires in far northern Sweden. That year, much of the Northern Hemisphere was scorched, with “22 percent of populated and agricultural areas simultaneously experiencing heat extremes between May and July,” according to a 2019 study in Nature."

Need help to deal with confusion surrounding contradicting scenarios related to slowdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
I recently have been reading a lot about the potential slowdown or shutdown of thermohaline circulation.    However, i am slightly confused.    For example, this interactive guide shows most cities on the Northeast coast of USA would experience hotter temperatures almost close to the sub-tropics: https://www.vox.com/a/weather-climate-change-us-cities-global-warming    On the other hand, I am also reading that the slowdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may also dramatically drop temperatures for large parts of the northeast coast of Northern America.    So what would it be like? Usually, when I think of climate change, I picture the interior of the US are drought-frequent semi-desert areas, which sharply transform into flood-prone areas when one is approaching the coast, which tend to be ravaged by extreme hurricanes.

" Update: How’s U.S. winter weather changing in a warming world?"
>Cold extremes are indeed waning over most of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere, but a decade-plus debate on the Arctic’s role continues.    >Another group has just as doggedly scrutinized decades of observations and computer-model replications of recent climate. They’ve confirmed that the sharpest cold extremes are becoming less frequent across most of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere, the broad belt between roughly 35 and 65 degrees north of the equator that covers much of the U.S., Canada, Europe, Russia, and China. And they suspect natural climate variation – rather than a rapidly warming Arctic – most likely explains why cold and snow extremes have maintained their edge in a few areas over the last several decades.

Cfa and Cwa
Could the humid subtropical climate be distinguished further with an extra letter? This is to reconcile the fact that New York City and Houston are technically both Cfa climates, but one is famous for its snowfall and the other famous for being snow-free. I propose an extra letter appended to these climates and two letters k and m, for the German words for continent and sea, respectively. The difference between the two Cfa cities is that Houston is very close to a southern coast around the 30th parallel. Houston is very close to a warm body of water that keeps its temperatures more moderate in winter. This oceanic influence also keeps it wet and rainy, similar to a Csa Mediterranean winter. This variant I will call Cfam, Humid Subtropical Maritime. This variant exists along the entire Gulf Coast of the US and northwest Mexico (which would be Cwam in this case), along with coastal southern China, northern Vietnam, India, Italy, and many immediately coastal Cfa and Cwa climates near the 30th parallel. New York City is a very northernly city with a Cfa climate, which means it exhibits continentality. The land is far enough away from warm ocean to regularly experience hotter summers and colder winters than Cfam, where the cooler oceanic air in summer acts as a fan. This variant is Cfak, Humid Subtropical Continental, which is typical of the inland Cfa regions of the US and China.  One pronounced difference is the ability to grow citrus. Texas, Louisiana, and of course Florida all have famous citrus fruits, as do Mediterranean climates with wet winters. Meanwhile, more northernly Cfa climates cannot support citrus in winter.  The k and m is also useful for distinguishing the subtropical highland climate from the marine west coast climate, which would otherwise both be Cfb (Cfbk for subtropical highland, Cfbm for Marine West Coast).

An AMOC collapse will probably not lead to severe cooling
. The studies which show such a cooling are a result of a profound bias towards cooling in the northern hemisphere (Danabasolgu et al. 2020), which increase the sea ice expansion, leading to more cooling. The sea ice expansion is even more extreme than what happened in the Younger Dryas, which actually warmed European summers (Schenk et al. 2018).     2. Global warming counteracts this. Cooling is heavily reduced under 2C of warming, and eradicated under 4C of warming (Westen et al. 2025), and this is still done with a model that has a huge cooling bias in the northern hemisphere. I’d expect that by the time the full impacts of the AMOC collapse has set in, we would be in at least 2.5C of warming.     3. An AMOC collapse would lead to a northward migration of the jet stream and the Hadley cell, due to Bjerknes compensation from heat buildup in the southern hemisphere (Orbe et al. 2023)    4. While sea temperature in the sub polar huge may decrease, the reduced mixing in Europe, and warmer summers from what I mentioned in point 3 (Oltmanns et al. 2018), leads to a result of no sea temperature reduction over Europe (Jackson et al. 2023)

Solar and wind are better than nuclear
Taken from a discussion:    Nickel Iron batteries do last for more than 100 years.  They can be easily repaired (after 100 years plus of use), if they need to be, by a layperson, for continued use thereafter.      Wind turbines consist of components that can ALL be repaired, refurbished, re-used, or recycled.  Specifically wind turbines consist of the blades to catch the wind, a gear and rod system, a motor/generator (stator and rotor, consisting of repairable, refurbishable, or easily re-usable or recyclable materials).  Solar panels can be refurbished.  Lets consider all of the materials used in solar panels minus the photovoltaic cells first.  They can all be re-used or recycled.  Spent photovoltaic cells have begun to be refurbished and recycled as well.    Nuclear reactor waste release radiation for hundreds of millions of years.  This is a permanent positive rate of damage to surrounding life on Earth.  This is well known.  Not to mention that accidents (which would be minor in any other case) are catastrophic to the extreme.  See the Marshall Islands, Fukushima, etc.  Nuclear reactors are a HUGE liability.    Nuclear has literally double to triple the cost to build compared to solar or wind.      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#Capital_costs    If you install a complete solar panel and battery system yourself to get off the grid, you get a variable return on investment, that increases exponentially with how little you spend a month on electricity.  This asymptotes at about 14% as the amount spent on electricity goes up, and increases to infinity as you spend less on electricity per month.  If you spend very little on electricity, using all the most efficient appliances you can get, you'll likely get a 100-200% return on your investment.  This assumes 8 hours of sunlight per day.    Again, Nickel Iron batteries have an even higher return on investment than the best batteries in common use today (LiFePh).  They are relatively simple  ... <truncated>

Jevons Paradox: What it is and what it’s not
**Jevons Paradox: What it is and what it’s not**    There’s a lot of confusion online about Jevons Paradox — especially when it’s used to argue that making renewables cheaper somehow *keeps fossil fuels alive*. That’s not what the paradox says. Let’s clear this up.    ---    ###  **What is Jevons Paradox?**    Jevons Paradox comes from 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons. He observed that **as steam engines became more efficient**, they made coal-powered energy cheaper — and total **coal consumption increased**, not decreased.    **In short:**    > *Making a resource cheaper or more efficient to use can lead to *more* demand for that same resource.*    Example:  - In the 1800s, **more efficient steam engines** made coal more useful. This led to an explosion in coal use and **displaced older tech like waterwheels** and manual labor.    ---    ### **What Jevons Paradox is *not***:    It’s not a law that says efficiency always backfires.    It’s not a reason why fossil fuels will persist forever.    And crucially, it **does not apply** when one energy source **replaces** another — that’s called **substitution**, not Jevons.    ---    ###  **Substitution is not Jevons**    Let’s look at some examples of substitution — cases where *new* energy or transport technologies displaced *older* ones:    -  **Cheap fracked natural gas** in the U.S. displaced coal in electricity generation. Gas was cheaper and cleaner, so coal plants shut down. That’s **not** Jevons — that’s substitution.  -  **Cheap automobiles** replaced horses. Nobody said, “cars got so cheap that we started breeding more horses.”  -  **Electric lighting** replaced gas lamps and candles. We didn’t suddenly consume more whale oil because LEDs got cheaper.  -  **Cheap solar and wind** are now displacing coal and increasingly gas, because they’re becoming the cheapest sources of electricity in many markets.    If Jevons Paradox applied in these cases, we’d see *more* of the old resource being used. But w ... <truncated>

Small modular nuclear reactors (ideally paired with molten salt)
Does anyone else believe these could provide the base load power of the future?    Pros: efficient, clean, tech exists, provides base load power and can pair with renewables, can use nuclear waste as a power source and makes little.waste itself (uses more than it makes), safe    Cons: expensive until it's truly modular, unproven/unbuilt, some say could cause nuclear proliferation but the countries that make the most CO2 already have nukes    If we committed to SMRs as a national/global priority and made them in bulk, found engineering efficiencies, and shipped to site it would likely be the cleanest cheapest available option. Working reactors could be rolling off the line in 7 years or so and would use waste from old reactors. New designs are walk away safe and integrate spent uranium into molten salt.     Wiki link for a primer: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_modular_reactor    There are dozens of designs with advantages and disadvantages. The best (imo) don't use pressurized water and are highly efficient.     Wind and solar as things stand (no grid scale battery tech) have to have natural gas plants as a backup. No one ever discusses this. The gas companies PUSH wind and solar because it keeps them relevant. No one discusses the added cost either.     This doesn't mean I'm against renewables, battery research should be tripled. But we can't wait for a holy Grail when we have excellent tech that needs to be built today.     I'm also for smart big(ish) nuclear such as the facility Bill Gates has backed (TerraPower). He's a smart and thoughtful dude that stands to lose only his time (and -lose- money) in developing this. He believes and has designed an amazing plant that is being held up from development because of the Trump trade wars (FTD).    Rant over :) What do you all think?

How to determine if batteries (plus wind and solar and grid energy transfer) are better for replacement of fossil fuel grid energy than nuclear, or if nuclear is better than batteries
About a month or so ago, I posted about the merits of solar and wind compared to nuclear.      While I asserted that wind and solar are generally better than nuclear, I conceded that nuclear is better than batteries (in conjunction with wind and solar) in terms of "capacity" and reliability.  Specifically, for example, solar with tracking (and batteries) is generally estimated to produce 5x the wattage of nuclear (see source below).    [https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table\_8.2.pdf](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table_8.2.pdf)    I noted that Nickel Iron (NiFe) battery technology is superior to what is currently being used, which is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePh), or other forms of Lithium battery technology, in that it is a higher return on investment, lasts much longer, can be easily repaired, is recyclable, and does very very little damage to the environment (basically negligible in the frame of reference of general battery technology).  The noteworthy downsides of NiFe are that it requires water to be added every few months, but this can be easily automated, and that the initial cost is high, but this would be negated upon mass production, and when comparing to a nuclear grid system they are likely to be cheaper, but it depends on the situation.    Credible sources consistently state that nuclear energy is of roughly equal environmental damage to solar and wind using Lithium batteries.  If Nickel Iron batteries are utilized, wind and solar would therefore be cleaner than nuclear.     In the discussion on that prior post, something was brought to my attention, which in hindsight and when trying to summarize it now in introducing the issue, seems simple, but I think the issue is more complex than it at first will appear.  Obviously, solar and wind aren't reliable.  Batteries need to be used to store energy for downtimes.  Now lets say we get no wind and lots of clouds for some variable number of consecutive days.

Opening Our Eyes to Climate Change Myths Perpetrated by Climate Skeptics and Deniers
[Climate change myths](https://greenthatlife.com/climate-change-myths/) abound. Why? Well, there’s a lot of power and money behind all this storytelling. The recent [study](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(21)00233-5) of oil giant ExxonMobil’s climate change messaging strategies is just a glimpse of what we’re up against in the battle against climate propaganda. Exxon’s decades-long rhetoric campaign has downplayed the reality and seriousness of climate change while shifting blame from industry to individual activities.    These and [other industry tactics](https://greenthatlife.com/surprising-greenwashing-examples/) have been successful in casting doubt on the seriousness of climate change. If we have any hope of combatting this climate crisis we need to open our eyes to these perpetrated climate change myths.

However, when I used the same data from that webpage and instead calculated "mean temperature" or "maximum temperature", the graph resembled what one might expect.

FYI: Debunked MacRae 2008 - No correlation between CO2 and temperature
There is a graph that is often linked to here, and elsewhere, in order to show that there is no correlation between CO2 and temperature.    For instance u/chronicalpain has linked to this graph numerous times, in order to support the claim that there is no correlation between CO2 and temperature over geological time spans.     [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-Temperature-and-CO2-levels-over-600-million-years-Source-MacRae-2008\_fig1\_280548391](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-Temperature-and-CO2-levels-over-600-million-years-Source-MacRae-2008_fig1_280548391)    The graph is a composite of temperature data and CO2 levels over 600 million years.    However, if you check the sources...    [The Scotese website](http://www.scotese.com/climate.htm) and the [2001 paper by Robert A. Berner and Zavareth Kothavala](https://doi.org/10.2475/ajs.301.2.182) (also available here: [https://sci-hub.mksa.top/10.2475/ajs.301.2.182](https://sci-hub.mksa.top/10.2475/ajs.301.2.182))    ...it becomes clear that the graph is deeply flawed and that none of the sources support the claim that there is no correlation between CO2 and temperature over geological times.     The temperature graph, allegedly (copied?) from Scotese, doesn't match the temperature graph found on the Scotese website.    Also, in the Berner&Kothavala paper the authors explicitly state that there is a correlation between CO2 and temperature.    >...    >    >*Thus,  exact values of CO2, as shown by the standard curve, should not be  taken literally and are always susceptible to modification.

Raw versus adjusted temperature data - is the data being fraudulently tampered with?
**TL;DR: NO.** [The raw and adjusted temperature data are in excellent agreement](https://i.imgur.com/TbtHeLB.png) (the black line is raw data). There is no evidence of any fraudulent manipulation of the data.    **Overview**    Often, skeptics of global warming allege that the surface temperature records are being fraudulently tampered with to show a rate of global warming that isn't real. One of the challenges in examining this charge is that the methods used to generate the global temperature products are fairly complicated, so it can be hard for laypeople to critically evaluate what is being done.     I've had an idea for a while now of creating a global temperature dataset that is constructed from the raw data using the simplest possible methods, so that anyone can compare it with the adjusted data from organizations like the NOAA or NASA and evaluate the impact the adjustments are having on the data while understanding exactly what has been done.    Finally I've gotten around to doing this, so wanted to share the results here, hoping to spark some discussion of this interesting topic. This dataset is a global land average. The method I used is extremely simple (so I've called the dataset simpleTemp), and applies no adjustments or corrections to the raw data whatsoever. The basic outline is as follows:    1. The stations are averaged into 5x5 grids. This is because some areas of the globe have a higher station density than others, so those areas will be unequally weighted if the stations are simply averaged individually.    2. The grid boxes are *spatially weighted*, since boxes nearer the poles are smaller than boxes nearer the equator, and some boxes are partially covered by ocean (this is only meant to be land temperature).    3. The series represents the average of the monthly *anomalies*. This is because stations can be moved over time, or come on and offline, so the anomalies prevents spurious trends from being introduced into the data.    Importantly, I  ... <truncated>

Someone said some of my ECS estimates were incorrect and that I missed some out so re-did it and came to a ECS of 1.8C for instrumental studies only. Carbon Brief says the average is 2C so I may have missed some or they may not be counting all the studies I am. For example, I counted Lindzen twice
The pro-AGW website Carbon Brief considers instrumental ECS estimates an outlier, saying: "Studies based on instrumental data are something of an outlier, tending to show a considerably lower estimate of around 2°C".    I got 1.8C so in close agreement.

Satellites temperature measurement are likely becoming increasingly unreliable: an underappreciated topic
We have a few space satellites that measure global temperature independently of ground stations.    My basic understanding is that they measure incoming (from earth) radiation level (irradiance).    Then with some maths, they derive the temperature from the received light spectrum.    Some satellites measure incoming infrared radiation, but the most popular ones measure incoming microwave radiation.    My main question is related to the use of thermometers on board of those satellites, their purposes.    Let's take for example the famous UAH satellite, its founder, Roy Spencer, says the following:    \>  Contrary to some reports, the satellite measurements are not calibrated in any way with the global surface-based thermometer records of temperature. They instead use their own on-board precision redundant platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) calibrated to a laboratory reference standard before launch.     platinum thermometers are simply a more accurate version of thermometers versus mercury based ones.    He says the satellite has onboard (redundant (2)) thermometers. Why and at which step in the temperature calculus pipeline are those thermometers used in the satellite?     The satellites are in near space (very cold) and their face that is solar exposed could be very hot. In both ways (space cold and heat) seems highly unrelated to measuring earth surface temperature.    If so, then what are the purpose of those thermometers onboard? How do they relate with the spectroscopic measure of incoming radiation?    Here is my tentative understanding:    I was able to find this UAH paper that says:    \> the spacecraft experience a slight E-W **drift** during the course of their operational life.    \> the (microwave) instrument is exposed to more direct sunlight and warms as a result. This warming is evidenced in the on-board platinum resistance **thermometer** which is embedded in the hot-target plate. **Christy et al. 2000** discovered the **dependency of** variati ... <truncated>

Radiative forcing
Was watching Dr happer explain his version of the equation for radiative forcing.   Looked pretty much like the same math that most scientists are using.   I was expecting some plot twist from him.  It pretty much showed an increase of 3 watts per meter sq for a doubling of co2.    That number on top of a baseline of about 277 w/ m2.  An increase of about 1%.  He calculated this to mean a temp increase of .7c.    Is the difference between his calculations and Micheal Mann for temp increase just the positive feedback?

Interactive Map visualizing Climate Change scenarios
I wanted to share a project I've been working on since last year that some of you might find interesting.    It's an interactive map that lets you explore global climate data at high resolution (1 km). You can switch between temperature and precipitation and compare historical data with future climate scenarios (SSP1, SSP3, SSP5 for 3 different periods until 2100). You can also toggle between monthly/yearly views and absolute/relative values for the scenarios. The website uses data from CHELSA (they provide downscaled CMIP6 data).    Would love to hear your thoughts, suggestions and ideas!

Hello, I was wondering what could explain the 0.7°C temperature increase from 1900-1940 and 0.7°C  temperature increase from 1980-2020 when there is a clear disparity in CO2 emission from these two periods: the cumulative CO2 emission from 1900-1940 is roughly 100Gt and cumulative CO2 emission from 1980-2020 is roughly 300-400Gt (if I'm not mistaken).

Global warming from a climate sensitivity of 1.4°C (based on 24 different studies)
Decided to make a graph showing the warming from CO2 based on a climate sensitivity of 1.4°C (which is the average of the studies in this graph [here](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QKd0oR56do4/XnjLlunnIEI/AAAAAAAARTQ/aNna9JOSNUAh1-ufbP1n6JyzeeMj3WcPgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/infographic+(48)+(1).png) since 2011). Might update it to include the most recent estimates in 2020 later. The graph shows that for the first 20ppmv increase in CO2 in the atmosphere, the warming is about 6°C. Then the next 20ppmv, taking it up to 40ppmv is 1.4°C. When it gets to 200ppmv then 20ppmv increments are reduced to 0.2°C and when it gets to 400ppmv then 20ppmv increments are reduced to 0.1°C. It seems to me that CO2 is having a real warming effect but it is miniscule and far too small to warrant drastic measures being taken worldwide to counteract it.    https://preview.redd.it/yebd5viqxyd51.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=65d837ee6a5e630819a1401007239d854ed3405b

Recent political science grad, unsure which master's degree to work in climate politics
Hi everyone, I have recently completed my undergrad political science degree and am taking a gap year before applying to graduate school. My undergraduate research was highly focused on the politics of climate change, and I completed my thesis on adaptation in the developing world (discussing action that has been taken on international/national/local levels).    My goals are to continue research on the politics of climate change/the environment, work as a policy advisor/consultant, and maybe obtain a PhD at some point. I'm not sure what Master's degree would be best  for me- I have been looking at an MA in Political Science at a university that does research in environmental politics, an Environmental Policy MA, a few Global Development/Governance programs, and am also thinking about a Master's in Public Policy.     As you can tell I'm very unsure lol, so any guidance would be very helpful!

How to make a Literature and Environment course interesting and engaging for undergraduates?
I am going to teach a Literature and Environment course for undergraduate students in the upcoming semester. The syllabus includes some fictional readings, environmental cartoons, and non-fictional/ eco-activist writings related to various ecological disasters.    Most of the students are from non-literary undergraduate courses such as business studies and computer science. While some students might have chosen this course to fulfil their syllabus requirements, I want to keep them interested in the classes and make it a valuable experience for them.    I am looking for suggestions and ideas to ensure that this is not just another course that students pass without being actively engaged. I'm considering the possibility of watching documentaries and discussing local issues that the students are familiar with, but I would like more suggestions. If you were taking this course, what would you want to learn?    Also, suggest some environment-related documentaries as well if you can.

Capturing carbon from the ocean
A UCLA research team has proposed [a pathway that could help extract billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/using-seawater-to-reduce-co2-in-atmosphere) each year. Instead of directly capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide, the technology would extract it from seawater, enabling the seawater to absorb more. Why? Because, per unit volume, seawater holds nearly 150 times more carbon dioxide than air. The captured CO^2 would be turned into a solid, thus greatly reducing the possibility of leaking into the atmosphere.

Catalytic Convertors Convert CO to CO2 and Why Are We Using Them?
Typically, there are two different catalysts in a catalytic converter: One of them tackles nitrogen oxide pollution using a chemical process called reduction (removing oxygen). This breaks up nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and oxygen gases (which are harmless, because they already exist in the air around us). I’m  The other catalyst works by an opposite chemical process called oxidation (adding oxygen) and turns carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide. Another oxidation reaction turns unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water. So in short, if burning fossil fuels creates CO and CO2 is actually a byproduct of removing CO from emissions, why haven’t we gone away from catalytic convertors to something more environmentally friendly?

Technical question: GWP and atmospheric lifetime
Hoping y’all could help me. Am trying to understand the relationship between GWP and atmospheric lifetime of a gas in more detail.    I understand in principle that short lived gases have faster decay and therefore further out GWP values eg GWP100 will be substantially lower than GWP20. However, I’m struggling to make sense of some numbers.     For example halogenated anaesthetic gases:  - Sevoflurane GWP100 = ~127 - 205 depending on which resource you use  - Sevoflurane atmospheric lifetime 1.4-2 yrs    How can it be that the GWP at 100 years (ie 50 lifetimes) is still 127x that of reference CO2 (per the GWP calculation)? I presume this has something to do with the technical definition of atmospheric lifetime…    Put another way, why wouldn’t the GWP20 of Sevoflurane be 0 if the lifetime is truly 1.4-2yrs in the atmosphere? If the GWP500 of Sevoflurane is 43 (per what I can find online) how is it “short lived” in terms of warming potential?     I do understand principles of exponential decay so it might be that the lifetime refers to when some fraction remains?     Thanks in advance for anyone who can help.

Can Methane Inhibitors Revolutionise Livestock Emissions Reduction? What is your opinion?
Methane inhibitors are a promising climate tech solution aimed at reducing methane emissions from cows, a significant contributor to global greenhouse gases. These inhibitors, available as feed additives or vaccines, disrupt methane production during digestion, offering a way to cut emissions without reducing livestock production. However, challenges include variable effectiveness, high costs, regulatory hurdles, and potential carcinogenic risks.    Methane Impact: Methane is 28 times more potent than CO2 in trapping heat and constitutes 40% of agricultural emissions, mainly from cows    Inhibitor Mechanism: Methane inhibitors like 3-NOP and red seaweed interfere with enzymes that produce methane in cows, reducing emissions by 30-99%, depending on conditions.    Adoption and Investment: 3-NOP is approved in several countries and used by major dairy producers, with significant investment from biotech and agricultural companies like DSM and Cargill.

Impact of "CO2-equivalent" gases
Hello everyone,    I'm trying to gain a better understanding of emissions and their impact beyond the blatant offset indulgence, and talking to a forester friend of mine I started thinking about the distinction, impact and means of neutralising CO2 vs. other GHG (or what might be needed to reduce and then balance out everything to achieve some kind of 2-3 degree target, but let's not get into the retail side here)      While typing up this post, I actually answered the initial question myself, which I still find a confusing way of looking at raw emissions.  A word of caution, maybe it was only my naive and uninformed first impression, but something like this:      Global GHG emissions ratio (compared by mass) [1]    76% CO2    16% Methane  6% Nitrous Oxide    2% F-gases        is actually often quoted as the absolute ratio of emissions, however it's already scaled to CO2-equivalent impact. So while it compares masses (tonnes emitted), it really compares impact on the greenhouse effect.   The actual mass (ratio) of methane emitted should be something like 16% / 28 = 0.57%, with 28 being the GWP [3,4] potency factor of methane compared to CO2.      I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING!! It just tripped me up while trying to understand the big picture, as even sources covering the emission of a single gas can depict that number in the unit of 'tonnes of CO-equivalent', rather than just 'tonnes' as a raw measurement or estimate.      My question (now) is:      Plants can capture CO2, is there anything besides filtering any given air or collecting emissions at the source (cow barn, landfill,..), so any mechanism besides 'natural atmospheric decay', that effectively manages to capture other GHG? (now that I know the real mass proportions, I assume sparsity makes it quite difficult) Even with proper CO2 neutralisation, additionality etc., am I right in thinking these other emissions can't be offset? Is there any leading opinion on how to deal with this then?     ... <truncated>

2 Main Carbon Capture Technologies And Their Main Challenges
Net zero demands action on both historical and ongoing carbon emissions.    While carbon capture technology has a long road ahead of development and is still difficult and expensive, it shows some promise in addressing historical and ongoing carbon emissions.    2 leading carbon capture technologies exist. Here they are:    # 🏭 Technology #1. Point-source carbon capture    Generally uses carbon filters.    It involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions from extensive industrial facilities, such as power plants or factories. There have been some prototypes for trucks as well.    Commonly called “carbon capture and storage” or CCS.     # 🌀 Technology # 2. Direct Air Capture    Captures carbon dioxide from the air using filters and chemical mixtures.    While it can capture carbon dioxide from any source, it is more expensive than point-source capture. For every million air molecules, 420 are CO2 molecules.     Putting this into perspective: it’s like searching for 420 special shells in the ocean among a million that are similar. Each time you complete the task, you start over and never stop!     # 🤔 Main open question    Once carbon dioxide has been captured, what can we do with it?    One strategy is to store it in the oceans’ sediments, where pressure can help keep it contained. Another method involves using depleted coal mines and oil and gas reservoirs. Some even think it can be reused as fuel. Crazy, right?    # 📈 Projections    The current projection for the carbon we can capture is 3.5 billion tons by 2050. While this is a lot, it is only a fraction of humanity’s 51 billion tons of emissions yearly.    Continued research and development on carbon capture technology and accounting will be critical for carbon reduction. Web3 and AI will undoubtedly be crucial tools.    &amp;#x200B;    https://preview.redd.it/6uvpx7btl0ma1.png?width=401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7b66f6a6b5c4caf4c317b0a1ea049aaae429b6c8    edit: Thanks  [**Particular\_Qui ... <truncated>

Though the figures cover only a six-month period from September 2020 to February 2021, they highlight an accelerating global trend of climate-related displacement, said Helen Brunt, Asia Pacific Migration and Displacement Coordinator for the IFRC. "Things are getting worse as climate change aggravates existing factors like poverty, conflict, and political instability," Brunt said. "The compounded impact makes recovery longer and more difficult: people barely have time to recover and they're slammed with another disaster." Some 60% of climate-IDPs (internally displaced persons) in the last six months were in Asia, according to IFRC's report. McKinsey & Co consulting firm has said that Asia "stands out as being more exposed to physical climate risks than other parts of the world in the absence of adaptation and mitigation". Statistics from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC) show that on average 22.7 million people are displaced every year. The figure includes displacements caused by geophysical phenomenon such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but the vast majority are displaced by weather-related events. Globally, 17.2 million people were displaced in 2018 and 24.9 million in 2019. Full-year figures are not yet available for 2020, but IDMC's mid-year report showed there were 9.8 million displacements because of natural disasters in the first half of last year. More than 1 billion people are expected to [**face forced migration by 2050**](https://reut.rs/3cyvw3i) due to conflict an ... <truncated>

Weather-Related Power Outages On Rise, Populations Growing, Grid Outdated
Between 2000 and 2021, about 83% of reported major outages (events with 50,000 homes or more without power) in the U.S. were caused by weather-related events, according to Climate Central. Also, the average annual number of weather-related power outages increased by roughly 78% during 2011-2021, compared to 2000-2010.        From 2000-2021, there were 1,542 weather related power outages. Most were caused by winter weather (22%), tropical storms (15%) and other severe weather (58%). Most of the activity has been hampering the Southeast, Midwest and Northeast. As for individual states with the most outages, Texas, Michigan, California, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. As for exact numbers of events effecting 50,000 or more homes, Texas (180), Michigan (132), California (129), North Carolina (97), and Pennsylvania (82)—all of which are ranked among the top 10 in populous states in the country.

Canals that once served as vital arteries for transportation and industry now face the consequences of industrial waste, sewage, and urban runoff. However, successful cleanup efforts from around the world offer valuable lessons that can be applied to America’s polluted canals. By examining case studies from New York to Singapore, we can explore effective strategies to restore these waterways and turn them into assets for communities and the environment.    # Gowanus Canal, New York: A Model of Advanced Techniques and Community Engagement    The Gowanus Canal in New York is one of the most polluted waterways in the United States, suffering from decades of industrial contamination and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Designated a Superfund site, the Gowanus Canal cleanup combines advanced remediation techniques, such as dredging and capping, with community involvement. The strategy involves removing contaminated sediments from the canal bed and capping it with clean materials to prevent re-contamination. Additionally, measures to control CSOs, a major source of ongoing pollution, are critical to the project’s success.    Community engagement plays a vital role in the cleanup effort. By involving local residents in education and monitoring programs, the project not only improves water quality but also fosters a sense of stewardship among the community. The Gowanus Canal serves as a model for integrating advanced remediation techniques with community involvement, highlighting the importance of public participation in achieving long-term environmental goals.    # Thames River, London: Infrastructure Overhaul and Regulatory Enforcement    The Thames River in London was once infamous for “The Great Stink” of  ... <truncated>

An essential guide to plant nutrition: rootzones, physiochemistry, development
[https://youtu.be/jApfieoD-zI](https://youtu.be/jApfieoD-zI)    The standards by which cultivators of crops, including the emerging plant of increasing import - Cannabis sativa, fertigate, or provide nutrients-are often erroneous - albeit improving - as optimal production is crucial across scales.    Plant growth and performance are often hampered as one or more components of the consortia of realms that encompass plant nutrition are overlooked or incompletely understood.    The central quantifiable tendencies for nutrition in plant biology are linked here to ecological research and experience cultivating cannabis as a bulwark from which to optimize growth, development, biomass production, and of course, the production of those secondary metabolites - Cannabinoids and terpenes.

Navigating New Horizons: A global foresight report on planetary health and human wellbeing
New report out from the United Nations Environment Programme.    Navigating New Horizons: A global foresight report on planetary health and human wellbeing     What is foresight and how does it compare to prediction?     "Prediction is passive: it means locking in a vision of the future. Foresight is about imagining the future and then looking at how to change it."    Here, the report draws on a wide diversity of disciplines and voices to foresee the future.     The report focuses on the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, but also combines with other key drivers of change, including social, technological, geopolitical, and AI, among many others. Indeed, we are facing a 'policrisis', whereby the triple planetary is impacting and exacerbating human crises like conflicts for resources and declining health. Taking a holistic view is important for understanding the whole situation.     It identifies old and emerging challenges that require immediate attention and have the potential to drastically impact planetary health. Eight critical global shifts or phenomena that emerged from the foresight process.    1. The relationship between humans and the environment in flux    2. Critical resources: scarcity, competition and the shifting dynamics of global security    3. AI, digital transformation and technology – a wave of change    4. A new era of conflict    5.

The project aims to produce clean energy through the generation of hydroelectric power, with a total installed capacity of 6.8 MW. The project was developed by Renewable Energy Developers S.A. (RED SA) in Honduras, in a partnership under Global-Climate Partnership governed by RDP Development BV from The Netherlands. The project is certified by the Gold Standard, which ensures that it meets rigorous environmental and social standards, and delivers real and measurable benefits to the local community. The Betulia Hydroelectric Project has numerous benefits, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the creation of local jobs, and the promotion of sustainable development in Honduras. The project is expected to improve the reliability and stability of the country's electricity supply, which is critical for economic growth and social development.

The Core Carbon Principles
Under the A. statement of the ICVCM (Governance), the fourth principle to follow in order to acquire high integrity and high quality carbon credits is:    4. Robust independent third-party validation and verification.     "The carbon-crediting program shall have program-level requirements for robust independent third-party validation and verification of mitigation activities".     This might include:  - The crediting program must set out rules for how VVB's become and remain accredited in relation to the carbon-crediting program, review the performance of the VVB and develop procedures guiding the VVB in their work.     - The rules include provisions on VVB's organisational structure and management organisational resources, validation and verification processes, information requirements, penalities for rule breaches and rules ensuring impartiality of the VVB and the avoidance of conflicts of interest

Trees can be a great alternative to air conditioning
Both economically and ecologically. If you live in a hot climate, or at least a climate with hot enough summers (or southern winters) when you are in need of air conditioning, planting some trees next to your home to shade it might do wonders. They will catch that hot sunlight that would otherwise heat your home into an oven, and turn that into oxygen, wood, and possibly fruit, and fight against climate change. When cold weather comes, they also self-regulate by shedding the leaves, so they will not shade our home as much when you don't need that shade.    Any ideas which trees would be the best for this? Of course it will heavily depend on your climate and location, and home size. For example you probably don't want a pine tree fopr this purpose, because it has probably the worst ratio of shading vs non-shading in different seasons, because of it's lack of leaves.    \---------------------------------------------------------------------------    My ideas:    Fruit trees: Have a bonus of producing edible fruit.    Paulownia: Beautiful looks, big leaves throwing a lot of shade, fast growing and producing high quality wood.    \---------------------------------------------------------------------------    GPT4's ideas:    Prompt: Trees could be a great alternative to air-conditioning, shade a house for no electricity cost while helping against climate change, producing wood and possibly fruits, and shedding leaves in winter so it doesn't shade the home when the shade is not needed.

Trees serve as a fantastic natural alternative to air-conditioning, and they provide numerous other benefits too. Choosing the right tree species depends on your location, climate, and specific needs.

Sequestering tons (literally) of carbon using permaculture - using coppice / pollard as natural carbon factories for biochar source material.
Climate change didn't go away - even though it's out of the spotlight  right now. We need carbon out of the air, and this is one of those  things where we do not need to focus on one thing. We can do ALL of the  things. [www.drawdown.org](http://www.drawdown.org) is a good resource for some of the things we  can do, but coppice/pollard systems are not on there.    Today I did [an update video on my coppice/pollard system that I am using to get carbon out of the air and into the ground](https://youtu.be/4va-9mZZQjo).     Why do coppice, pollard (or ancient Japanese method called Daisugi)  versus just planting trees? Firstly, we should do either, or, we should  do both. Planting trees is something we obviously need to repair  deforested lands, and nothing works there but planting new trees.  However, that doesn't mean that where we currently have trees, we cannot  leverage systems like coppice / pollard (and Daisugi) to sequester MORE  carbon there also.    A coppice / pollard system is nothing more than cutting existing trees  VERY AGGRESSIVELY and causing the tree to regrow from the stump. Not all  trees can do this, as many will simply die once cut. However, some  trees (such as sumac) have been shown to respond very vigorously to  being cut down. This is typical of rhizome spreading trees who form  giant mats of roots underground and send new runners up. These tend to  respond very well when harvested for lumber, and regrow with tons  (literally) of vegetative new growth. All this new growth is carbon  being ripped out of the atmosphere and stored in wood.    Nitrogen fixers such as seabuckthorn can be used in the same way - and  the harvesting itself will trigger root disassociation of the nitrogen  clusters underground and will provide a slow release fertility boost (in  situ) to the whole system surrounding it. I may transition to these,  however the ease of using sumac (no thorns) and the ease at which it  produces fantastic biochar is attractive. Speaking of  ... <truncated>

Disclaimers: obviously this is not a replacement for solving industrial emissions, this is a "yes, and" post.

To reverse climate change
A scientifically valid, tangible and practical way to begin reversing climate change.      Plant plants. As many as any plot of land can hold. The faster growing and and woodier stemed plants are best for capturing CO2.     Grass in not effective at removing large quantities of CO2. So I recommend we turn every plot of grass into a plot of diverse trees and shrubs. Grass does not hold on to rain water and is easily destroyed opening the soil up to sun exposure which sterilizes the microbes.    On land already degraded we would till or mix in compost plant ground covers to protect it then plant larger beings for the longterm reversal of the CO2 heat retention effects. Reducing heat sinks and waves.      Reducing the heat increases moisture in the air allowing for rains, in now more desert-forming like climates, to return.     It will take a couple years, maybe five if you did the planting quickly. A lot of artificial watering would need to occur but less and less as the smaller shrubs and ground cover became established.     I live in the Seattle metropolitan area that was a temperate rainforest year round. It is now taking on the appearance of a hot dry and arid landscape with increasing lower yields of rainfall.     I can literally see desertification happening on every block. Barren ground is desertification. Soils continue to degrade and more plants go away. Furthering the degradation cycle.     If we dont start planting more plants or working towards them getting in the ground we are actively hurting every day just by existing.     Lets face it. Stopping our CO2 emissions is not practical and every effort that takes money away from rebuilding the earths soils and biomes through planting of plants is a farce and a distraction.    I want to live and its not looking good. Think, 5 years of heavy planting, could neutralize a lot of what were seeing. Another 5, and maybe even a complete reversal     Thank you for your time

Tips from a Florida man to keep cool in this intense heat in the UK.
As a Miami native for over a decade, the heat index for 3 months is usually 105-110 in the day factoring in the humidity. Here are some tips to keep you cooler in the intense heat.    1) Always carry at least 1L of water.  In Miami, during the summer I never leave the house without at least a liter of water in my hand.  You will constantly sweat; and you will need to replenish constantly.    2) electrolytes are important as well.. so try and eat food high in potassium as well, V8 drinks, bananas and vegetables are very good at stocking the body with much needed potassium and sodium electrolytes to prevent cramps.    3) In the day, find the shadiest route if possible.. always look for the route with the most shade, as the sun will literally cook you alive if you stay in too long at those temperatures .    4) If you can find a breezy location too, the ocean breeze here moderates the heat a little, even though our ocean is also hot, in the UK it will be even more relief.    5) If you experience signs of heat exhaustion or stroke, don’t be afraid to go to the ER. Rapid heartbeat , nausea, delirium, confusion, excessive thirst and the absence of sweating in the heat are all signs.    6) stay near a water source if possible, for a quick way to cool off.    7) Wear sunblock and a wide brimmed hat.    After many years in this climate I am acclimated and can handle the heat better as well, the body adapts.

I remember in the summer of 2023, me and my family went to go play paintball and the temperature outside was 113ºF (45ºC) with about 85% humidity that day too, so it was just miserably hot. Although that was the hottest day I’ve ever experienced so far and no summer has been that hot, the summers are still scorching hot to the point where I genuinely just hate being outside. Its killing my interest for being outside anytime that isn’t peak winter or fall (which we also don’t get thanks to the average temperature for a day in fall this year being 80º) which really sucks because I genuinely love being outside and I love being out in nature, but recently, its just been so swelteringly hot that any sort of physical activity in the summer requires at least a gallon of water on hand.     I wish it was just the summer too because then at least we’d have a season that is at least tolerable, but recently the fall has also just been nonexistent. The average day over here is about 75-80ºF (23.8-26.67ºC) and we have periods (typically about 3-5 days long) where the temperature drops down to 60ºF (15.56ºC) which is welcomed, but the temperature isn’t staying constant at all, we get waves of hot weather followed by cold weather and rinse and repeat with no constant hot or cold temperature for more than a few days.

I found some people online talking about how cold it is in their country and wish to live where it's hot so they can walk butt naked, please don't wish that, because your body has already adopt your climate (cold climate) you'll can not handle the sudden hot weather, I'd rather die freezing than having a heat stroke. I have to wait months just for winter to come, and that's in mostly in December, and strongly in January and February, as my body starts to adopt the cold weather in those months and boom here comes March, it's suddenly so hot the next day, weather is so goddamn harsh, naked or not it's bloody hot, it makes me want to peel my skin off. The only time I'd be happy in those hot weather is when a hurricane is coming, because most of the time it's just light rain and wind, and the next hour it's bloody hot again.

The spatial aggregation accounts for differences in grid cell size with latitude (i.e., cosine weighting) as well as the fraction of land and ocean areas within coastal grid cells. Monthly ratios are computed by dividing the areal extents experiencing warm records with the areal extents experiencing cold records.

Need help understanding the significance of consumption vs territorial emmisions.
Hi, so [this](https://imgur.com/FKYcUi7) is the graph produced by the UNEP showing the emissions of the 4 biggest GHG producing countries with consumption vs territorial based emmissions. According to the report " In the 2000s, there was a growing gap between consumption-based emissions in developed countries and their territorial emissions. This gap was larger than the reductions made under the Kyoto Protocol (Peters et al. 2011)."  I'd like to know what the significance of this "gap" is and why the Kyoto Protocol wanted countries to make an effort in "reducing" and "stabalizing" the gap as the report seems to suggest- " Since the global financial crisis in 2008, the gap has stabilized, and even declined. China contributed to most of the growth in the 2000s, but also the stabilization in the 2010s (Pan et al. 2017)"

“After falling by around 4.5% in 2023, emissions in advanced economies were lower than they were fifty years ago in 1973… in contrast with the previous temporary declines in 1974-75 and 1982-83, advanced economy emissions have been in a structural decline since 2007.” “This transformation in the electricity sector has pushed advanced economy coal demand back to a level that had not been seen – outside of briefly in the Great Depression – since around 1900. Since its peak in 2007, coal demand has nearly halved.”

Is there a statistic that shows how much of a country's production based emissions are exported in the form of products?
So, for example, China produces A LOT of stuff, and it exports A LOT too. I want to see how much of the in-country production based emissions go towards export, and how much towards in-country consumption.    And also the same thing for imports. How much of emissions of other countries China imports in forms of products to consume, for example.    Idk how products like hydrocarbons would be accounted for. Since, for example, much of them are imported into China and go toward production, and much of the products are then exported, those consumed hydrocarbon emissions seem to be in a way rerouted to be consumed elsewhere.    I hope my layman description gets across what I am looking for. Grateful for your help.

In 2023, CO2 emissions from the global electricity sector would have fallen, but the global shortfall in hydropower generation due to droughts drove up emissions — China continued to dominate global clean energy additions — Per capita emissions in China are now 15% higher than in advanced economies
IEA CO2 Emissions in 2023 Executive Summary: https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-in-2023/executive-summary                 >Global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by 1.1% in 2023, increasing 410 million tonnes (Mt) to reach a new record high of 37.4 billion tonnes (Gt). This compares with an increase of 490 Mt in 2022 (1.3%). Emissions from coal accounted for more than 65% of the increase in 2023.                >The global shortfall in hydropower generation due to droughts drove up emissions by around 170 Mt. Without this effect, emissions from the global electricity sector would have fallen in 2023.                 >Between 2019 and 2023, total energy-related emissions increased around 900 Mt. Without the growing deployment of five key clean energy technologies since 2019 - solar PV, wind, nuclear, heat pumps, and electric cars - the emissions growth would have been three times larger.                    >Thanks to growing clean energy deployment, emissions are seeing a structural slowdown. In the decade to 2023, global emissions grew slightly more than 0.5% per year, the slowest rate since the Great Depression.                    >Advanced economy GDP grew 1.7% but emissions fell 4.5%, a record decline outside of a recessionary period. Having fallen by 520 Mt in 2023, emissions are now back to their level of fifty years ago. Advanced economy coal demand, driven by evolutions in the G7, is back to the level of around 1900. The 2023 decline in advanced economy emissions was caused by a combination of structural and cyclical factors, including strong renewables deployment, coal-to-gas switching in the United States, but also weaker industrial production in some countries, and milder weather.                     >Emissions in China grew around 565 Mt in 2023, by far the largest increase globally and a continuation of China’s emissions-intensive economic growth in the post-pandemic period.

According to McKinsey & Company, the transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 would require an average annual investment of about $9.2 trillion in physical assets. This represents an increase of $3.5 trillion more than current spending levels. The total expenditure on this transition is estimated to be around $275 trillion from 2021 to 2050, approximately 7.5% of the global GDP annually. The increase in spending would be most substantial between 2026 and 2030.

The role of labor and capital in sectoral CO2 emissions
Our research showed that for the world's leading emitters of China, India, and the United States, compared to the fixed capital usage, the employment of the primary input of labor induces a larger amount of carbon emissions. Therefore, along with better management and utilization of fixed capital resources, the focus should be on labor training and reallocation of labor from highly carbon-intensive to less carbon-intensive industries (sectors). Furthermore, unclean imports and financial services to major carbon-importing sectors should be strictly supervised.

Why does Qatar have such high per capita CO2 emissions, even compared to its oil-producing neighbours?
According to OurWorldInData, the world's highest [per capita CO2 emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions) are those of Qatar, at 35.59 t (as of 2021). The 2nd highest is Bahrain, at 26.66 t, then the 3rd highest is Kuwait, at 24.97 t.    Does the Qatari lifestyle differ significantly from those of other comparable oil producers on the Persian Gulf? These countries are all known for their wealth and extravagance, but what is Qatar doing differently so that its emissions are more than 1/3 higher than other oil producers on the Persian Gulf? Is their construction project for the World Cup more CO2 intensive than other megaprojects in the region (for example Neom in Saudi Arabia, or the various megaprojects in Dubai)?

US releases 120 lbs per person perday of CO2- better way to express scope of the issue
United States,  for each  man woman or child produces on the order of  120  pounds of CO2 per day.To be clear, I am saying the US produces nearly 500 pounds of CO2  for a family of 4, every single day, with no breaks for Christmas, Passover or Ramadan.  I use this measure, because gigatons, tons annually are numbers for which perspective is difficult. Pretty easy to understand in measurements we all use day in and day out. Pounds per person per day, is a number which I have personally seen hardened (non-professional) deniers blink at- because it’s objectively ridiculous, without even the understanding of CO2’s warming effects on the earth. It’s like how compound interest might only be a dollar or two a day, but adds up  to a lot after awhile. Similarly 38 billion pounds of CO2 every day for decades eventually adds up to a lot. 120 pounds per person per day is what you get if you do the math on the EPA’s estimate of US greenhouse gas emissions, similarly to the math I do on the oil production number. However, it does not take into account imported content- US imports of goods which produce greenhouse gases in other places. Chat GPT estimates it below. There are other places where estimates are used and the results could be even more, https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions The most certain number in this estimate  is the oil consumption number- because the oil companies, oil markets and the US government base prices on inventories and shipments. The kind of thing is  58 pounds per person per day. Being that it is a big source, but one of many (agriculture, buildings, power plants) it verifies the scale of the EPA’s numbers.

The Impact of Direct and Indirect COVID-19 Related Demand Shocks on Sectoral CO2 Emissions: Evidence from Major Asia Pacific Countries
[**https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169312**](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169312) COVID-19's demand shocks have a significant impact on global CO2 emissions. We estimated the impact of COVID-19's direct and indirect demand shocks on CO2 emissions in the Asia-Pacific countries of Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan (BCIIP). We demonstrated that direct demand shocks, with a negative 85%–63% share, were responsible for the majority of the reduction in CO2 emissions. The downstream indirect demand contributed only 15%–37% to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Given BCIIP's current economic recovery, a CO2 emissions reduction of less than 1% is more likely in the coming years.

What is the Climate Sceptic response to the declaration in the article Bioscience declaring climate emergency?
It seems to me the science of predicted climate change effects is too complex for any substantial percentage of non-experts to have an informed opinion. The rational approach is to accept the authority of experts.     If we have that many experts warning of “catastrophic consequences” what reason do people give to disregard them?    > Professor Ripple said the paper was a form of what he described as "scientific advocacy". We are basing our conclusions on science that is not really disputed," he said. "The key here is that it's evidence-based and science-based."    I know the doomsday anxiety is on the rise since then. But surely this is not only justified, it’s the rational response to such a warning. Does anyone expect us to believe that many scientists would take a such a drastic step without being very confident of their scientific predictions? That is a conspiracy theory of epic proportions.      Do you think the mood has shifted among sceptics? If they haven’t adjusted their views, what reasons do they give for ignoring, or disregarding the alarming warning?

What is the most persuasive argument for laypeople that climate is very sensitive to CO2 (without appealing to authority)?
Hi all,    *I was wondering, what do you believe is the most persuasive argument in favor of the IPCC's claims of a high sensitivity of climate to increased CO2?*    The background for my question is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzM5XGPl0_A) rundown of the persuasion techniques used by either side in an old 2007 debate on climate by Mallen Baker. Mr. Baker argues that appealing to authority ("the science is settled", "97% of scientists" etc. etc.) rather than giving a persuasive argument is why the audience were not swayed by the scientists in this particular debate, where the audience voted on their stance before and after the debate.    *So I was wondering, how should the scientists have argued instead to be more persuasive?*    This is an important question, as if you want to motivate people, you need to "*start with why*", and as leaders of companies and whole countries now want to perform a "green shift", they need to motivate employees and citizens to join the effort. So you need a simple and persuasive argument to get laypeople onboard.    So my question basically boils down more to a question of rhetoric rather than facts. As you will have guessed, I agree with Mr. Baker that *appeals to authority are not rhetorically very persuasive.* I often see AR5 thrown out as be-all and end-all argument, but a 1500 page scientific report is in my mind not persuasive to laypeople, it becomes another appeal to authority.    I think that a *shorter or simpler argument is more persuasive* than a longer and more complex argument. Ideally a good argument could be convincing on a "single slide" or as a "two-minute pitch".    Any ideas?

Were climate scientists really wrong so many times in the past, or are the claims I keep seeing misleading?
I keep seeing posts from climate change deniers saying that scientists have consistently made wrong predictions about climate patterns in the past. I came across this website making claims of all the times incorrect theories were spread.   https://ethanparmet.substack.com/p/the-history-of-failed-climate-change    What is actually going on here? Are these just cherry picked examples and most of the time we are actually right?  Does this actually represent an issue with the media and how it can spread misinformation by trying to get more engagement with catchy headlines, rather than an issue with what the science actually says? I know that there can be a large disconnect between the public’s understanding of science and the actual scientific understanding of the time. The media can give spotlight to people with fringe ideas and crazy predictions, and present it as the accepted facts. So I would not doubt that you could go back through history and find examples of media reporting incorrect predictions.     Not to mention science and technology are constantly evolving and we will get things wrong sometimes as our understanding evolves and models improve.     Are their criticisms valid in any way, or is it   just weaponising bad predictions from the past to push an agenda today?     I am an everyday person so I can’t really judge the evidence. I trust modern science though, and would be grateful if anyone could tell me the actual facts.

Is there something about the Human psychology that makes them reject expert opinions?
This may seem like a strange question, especially here, but it's one that I've often wondered. We see this again and again and again, people rejecting the scientific mainstream and legitimate experts in favor of fringe thinkers and non-specialists. We see it with evolution, with Covid-19 and, most significantly, with climate change. Deniers cite people such as Lomborg, Shellenberger and Peterson. Doomers follow the likes of Bendell, McPherson and Wells. Both will justify this by stating that those individuals are all scientists, which is true- but none of them are climate scientists. They've all been consistently wrong, which their supporters like to ignore completely. Why do organizations like the NOAA and NASA, who have been consistently correct in their projections and models since at least the 1980's, get smeared and dismissed so often? Even the IPCC, which tends to be somewhat censored due to their government ties, has still been overwhelmingly accurate. Is it that people can't handle the nuance of it? Do they need someone to tell that everything is either going to be alright or that it's all hopeless?

Has winter become cancelled indefinitely?
For those of us who live in the mid-Atlantic, northeastern or northern midwest of the USA? Where I live, winter has always been a guarantee of cold weather and snow, snow, snow! So much that we'd get sick of it and beg for the sight of spring.    It's absurd, now you turn on the national news and they're begging, pleading with mother nature "give is a decent snow storm!". It doesn't happen. Time after time, the storm clouds arrive, it gets warm and it starts to rain. Right now we're dealing with gale force winds and flood water and it's 45 degrees in January.    This distinct change has been a pattern the past 5 or so years, same thing every time. No snow, not really that cold from November to March, but a lot of rain with unusual high temps. Granted the summer isn't particularly any different than it used to be, spring and fall are in usual form. It's just winter, isn't winter anymore.    So far this year I've kept count, we've had a single 1 inch snow, and 3 partial dustings in WV. We used to see accumulating snowfall regularly from November to March, and get a handful of major snow storms each year. My nephew has never even played in the snow or been sledding since he was old enough to remember it. I think the last time it really snowed, he was maybe 4 or 5. I have distinct memories of playing in snow up to my knees, sledding, building igloos, and shoveling driveways and paths until there were huge walls of snow on either side, pleading for school cancellation every week during another bout of snowfall...    I didn't think I would ever miss winter this much, but it sucks living in a climate where it's just like a more rainy and dreary fall. Anybody else dealing with the cancellation of winter? Will winter ever make a return, or is it gone forever?

Who remembers the great cold wave of January 20th 21st, 1985? Also Heatwave of 2021
I was just a baby in '85, however due to wunderground have seen the temps in the mid afternoon and it seems unbelievable. Nashville has ever had an entire day below zero in history but the warmest on the day of the 21st was 7 degrees BELOW ZERO. (7 above at midnight is the official high) All of Ohio failed to reach 10 BELOW that day and all-time record lows were already set by 10 that evening in some areas. Temps did not fall any and actually rose during the night. Nashville was 16 BELOW at midnight and fell to 17 BELOW the 21st, breaking their all-time record. The nations cold spot was Knoxville at 24 BELOW. Since 1985, the lows in Nashville have not been anywhere near these levels. In fact, from 1996 to 2022, Nashville never once went below zero during the night much less all day. How did this happen in 1985? I rarely see a long time station breaking all time records by 10 degrees but several stations in the Ohio Valley did just that. 1899 in Texas was the only other occurrence of such. The heatwave in Portland in 2021 also broke all-time records of 9 degrees as a more recent example - that Portland hit 116 degrees is another story all into itself. To break an all-time record by even 2 degrees is a huge event unto itself but 9 degrees in 150 POR?

Are spring and fall basically “gone”?
Was having this discussion with someone. I’m in New York. I’m 33.    When I was a kid during the 90s and early 2000s, seasons existed. Butterflies and lightning bugs were numerous in summer and fall. The air smelled a certain way as spring gave way to summer. Life in general felt more “in balance.”    Now it seems like spring is maybe at best a week or two and then you just rush into high temperatures, and Fall maybe lasts a week or two also before rushing into winter.    My question is two fold:    Are these seasons basically gone?    And how did it happen so quickly? 30 years isn’t very long.

Request for feedback on my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals
I recently finished reading Count Down ([https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1](https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1)) by Shanna H. Swan & Stacey Colino (2020) which is about how toxic chemicals including endocrine disrupting chemicals are damaging our health including our sexual health. I am brand-new to this subject and I was shocked by how much harm we are doing to ourselves. As I was reading the book I was noting down recommendations by the authors for how to avoid toxic chemicals with an eye towards writing some kind of list I could share with my family & close friends.    After reading the book I felt like a "starter list" would be best to focus on "Do's & don't's" as the easiest entry point.

Good alternatives to carpets include solid wood, tile, cork or natural linoleum flooring  * If you do choose to have carpet, opt for natural materials  * When selecting area rugs, choose wool or natural plant materials. Look for materials such as jute, seagrass or sisal, and natural rubber nonskid padding.  * Use low-VOC adhesives to install carpets  * Regardless of flooring, use doormats and don't wear shoes indoors.

Is there a name for commercial reuse of shelf stable containers?
I had an idea that seems absurdly simple, but my google searches haven't come up with any company that is doing this. I figured this would be the community that could tell me if this is being done already and what the correct term for it is, or if this can't be done for a reason I am not aware of.    The idea is for a grocery store to buy back used shelf stable containers such as jars for the purpose of reusing them to package similar products, that way the consumer is only paying for the product and not the packaging.    For example a grocery store sells a jar of pasta sauce to a customer that has been packed so that it is shelf stable. The customer takes the jar home and stores it in the pantry until they feel like making pasta. After they pour out the sauce they set the jar and lid aside with a bunch of other empty jars purchased from the same store. Lets assume all the jars are of a uniform size of one of 3 uniform sizes depending on the product sold in them.     On the next grocery run the customer brings all the jars they have been put aside to the store and feeds the jars into a sorting machine outside the store. The sorting machine identifies if the jars are compatible with this store's jarring system and give cash or store credit for all the returned jars.     Inside the grocery store there is small a jar sanitation and refilling operation. Big industrial bags full of pastas sauce, pickles, and other products are shipped in along with some replacement jars. The Jars are cleaned and sterilized in store then refilled from the bags to keep shipping costs to a minimum. The automated filling machine is responsible for filling the jars in a sanitary environment to keep them shelf stable.  If it is too much to ask a grocery store to do this, the jars and industrial bags could be shipped to a local sanitation and refilling operation thus still saving on shipping costs but to a lesser degree.

Did you know that the plastic trash bag is a Canadian invention?
Many condo and apartment complexes in Canada have strict garbage disposal rules that require residents to place their trash in a sealed plastic trash bag before putting into the communal bin for pick up. But, where do all these trash bags come from? And, what happens to them when after they are picked up by the disposal truck?    &#x200B;    [Plastic Kitchen Trash Bag](https://preview.redd.it/2ys7wfon8e171.jpg?width=2240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=109f7b8f08a3d15173dacdb62cb5fbb61188b9b0)    Most plastic trash bags are made from polyethelene pellets that are heated and subjected to a high pressure process that turns them into a flexible plastic. They are then coloured, cooled, sealed at one end, and cut into individual bags. While there are a couple of processes that can be used in making polyethelene pellets, both methods use petroleum distillates that are combined with catalysts to make various types of plastics. In other words, the base material to make these plastics comes from crude oil initially. Most of the plastics produced today are made using petroleum distillates.    &#x200B;    [Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/m2b4xsqp8e171.jpg?width=2670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39c8fddd4a65e412d6605829b69d5d0e74587db0)    Here’s a little plastic trash bag history:    In 1950, Harry Wasylyk, Larry Hansen, and Frank Plomp made the first plastic garbage bags. These garbage bags revolutionised the garbage disposal industry, making it a less dirty and less smelly business. These first trash bags were not biodegradable, however, so in 1971 yet another Canadian, Dr James Guillet, invented the first photodegradable trash bags. Guillet’s trash bags biodegrade in the landfill in the presence of sunlight, air, and moisture. As they break down, these biodegradable trash bags become smaller and smaller pieces of plastic that eventually enter our waterways and oceans.     &#x200B;    [Photo from maxpixel.net](https://preview.redd.it/4yfl2xir8e171.jpg?width=64 ... <truncated>

The Great Trash Bag conundrum?! How do you dispose of your and pets waste...
So for about 10 years I accepted all grocery plastic bags and reused them for pet waste and as kitchen trash bags. Then for about 10 years I have been using reusable shopping bags but getting the odd plastic bag here or there. I reuse anything that can be a bag like pet food bags and litter boxes. I do compost food waste and recycle and attempt to not buy things w minimal pain packaging etc.    BUT obviously I still need some garbage bags. (Incidentally my trash goes to be incinerated at a waste to energy plant not a landfill)  So to have the most impact should I buy recycled ocean plastic bags or plant-based bags or something else?

No other product has ever saved this much plastic from a landfill. Plus the amount of carbon footprint that my invention saves goes beyond needing to ever go to the store. Ship only the concentrate(dry  or liquid) directly to the end user.   1.  Appliance size (microwave size or smaller that can be installed in the Kitchen or Laundry room)    2 . Kiosk size. (example- soda vending machine) 24 bottles at a time or can refill larger bottles up to 5 gallons.   3.  Mobile. Natural Disasters for relief of supplies (large truck versions). Bleach Water Cleaning products. Refill existing bottles.  Cleans and refills  existing water bottles.   Cleaning products -   Wet wipes (cleaning towels) are made and dispensed into existing bottles (Appliance size can do singles or multiples wet towels).   Laundry detergent, Softener, 409 cleaning, Bleach (disinfection), Shampoo, Hand soap,   Any product that calls for clean water to be used with either liquid or dry concentrate (gatorade, energy drinks ect ). We can save 75%or more bottles from the landfill.    I currently have no partners. Building the prototype and I'm boot strapped and looking for someone to team up with.

Four ethical and sustainable fabric alternatives to polyester fast fashion
It's no secret that fashion has a lot to answer for, but we're doing something about it at The Fashion Advocate. [**We don't sell polyester**](https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/news/were-committed-to-a-more-sustainable-slow-fashion-future-so-we-no-longer-sell-polyester) fashion and we advocate for sustainable, slow, ethical fashion. We also operate with a [**'10 value system'**](https://thefashionadvocate.com/blogs/ethical-and-sustainable-fashion-online/ethics-sustainability), and all of our brands share a minimum of three of our ten values.    Doing our part to have a positive fashion impact is important to us, so every year we commit to one major sustainability change for the better. Last year, it was ditching polyester fashion. Why? Because 63% of fashion is now made with polyester, a synthetic fabric produced with petrochemicals and non-renewable resources. It's a nasty, environmentally devastating fabric, and it has no place in our wardrobes.    Nearly 70 million barrels of oil are used each year to make the world's use of polyester, and oil is a non-renewable resource. Once it's gone, it's gone. Polyester garments also take more than 200 years to break down, but they never decompose; tiny plastic particles exist forever.    So, what's the solution? Ditch polyester and switch to natural, biodegradable, renewable fabrics in your wardrobe, and choose to shop ethically and sustainably.    There are plenty of sustainable alternatives to polyester fast fashion. Natural fabrics like cotton, hemp, silk and Tencel are better for the environment, less energy-intensive, biodegradable, and they're a healthier option to wear too. The skin is the largest organ, so everything we put on it, goes in it, including the chemicals found in our clothing - another great reason to boycott polyester.

Question?
As you all probably know, Tuvalu has already begun migrating its citizens due to rising sea levels, which essentially marks the end of the country. Do you foresee a similar fate for my father's country, The Bahamas, as well as countries like the Maldives?    I believe that both the Maldives and The Bahamas have the potential to survive for a long time compared to nations like Kiribati, Palau, and Nauru, primarily because they are relatively wealthy. If they invest in building land and artificial islands, as the Maldives has already done, they may be better positioned for the future. However, I am uncertain about what The Bahamas is doing; it seems that they are primarily bringing in billionaires and leasing out much of the land.    What do you all think The Bahamas should do to ensure its survival for the long term?

Climate change and suicide
At this point it seems highly likely that we are hurdling towards an apocalyptic scenario where collapsing supply chains and supercharged natural disasters lead to millions/billions of deaths, and potentially the collapse of civilization as we know it. And this could potentially happen within a decade or two.     As a young person still in college it feels as though I essentially have no future other than this oncoming hellscape.  I don't feel actively suicidal at the moment as there are still people I care about and things I feel passionate about, but as things unravel and living becomes more miserable I think that might change.    At what point does it become rational to choose to go out on your own terms rather than suffering and dying as a result of the devastating impacts of climate change?

How to Cope and Prep
So I've done my research, gotten a few sustainability certifications, talked to some experts and the result seems inevitable. We are absolutely cooked. This is a 2 part question and pessimistic at that.    1. How do you all cope knowing we, Gen Z, will be the last generation to die of old age (if we even make it)? Everyday I just see more concrete proof that within the next 20-30 years our world will look completely different, societies around the world collapsing, famines, disease outbreaks. How do you go on living life knowing that a 401k is pointless, you'll never have kids, and you might not even see your 50s?    2. How are you all preparing? I have some plans but they require a large amount of money I don't have in order to buy land in certain places that will probably be somewhat less impacted. Once crops start to fail or governments start to crumble I forsee "humanity" going out of the window for most and it terrifies me. People will say learn farming, hunting, etc. I live in major city currently and work a 9-5 so I don't have the resources or time to really learn these skills. I have basic WFA training and that's about it. How do you survive the inevitable collapse that is coming when climate change's impacts reach that certain threshold?

Chemtrails are a psy-op and Contrails are a big part of the problem
"While optically thick cirrus clouds have a net cooling effect on surface temperature, optically thin cirrus clouds, like greenhouse gases, can have a warming effect 15,18. Aircraft emissions and contrails at cirrus altitudes have the potential to either cause optically thin cirrus clouds to form (that would have a warming effect on surface temperatures) or increase the optical thickness of existing clouds (or induce new optically thick clouds), thus, causing a net cooling effect. Enhanced observations of the effects of aircraft on cirrus cloud properties are needed to help bound and quantify these possible effects."

How does water vapor and CO2 interact in our warming climate? Often the two are confused, with an argument made that water vapor is the culprit.
Below are useful references that shed more light on this topic.     Columbia University     https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/07/30/co2-drives-global-warming/#:~:text=CO2%20makes%20up%20only%20about,to%20escape%20without%20being%20absorbed.  "CO2 makes up only about 0.04% of the atmosphere, and water vapor can vary from 0 to 4%. But while water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, it has “windows” that allow some of the infrared energy to escape without being absorbed. In addition, water vapor is concentrated lower in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 mixes well all the way to about 50 kilometers up. The higher the greenhouse gas, the more effective it is at trapping heat from the Earth’s surface.    Both water vapor and CO2 are responsible for global warming, and once we increase the CO2 in the atmosphere, the oceans warm up, which inevitably triggers an increase in water vapor. But while we have no way to control water vapor, we can control CO2. And because we are increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by continuing to burn fossil fuels, even in relatively small amounts compared to the entire mass of the atmosphere, we are disturbing the entire heat balance of the planet."    World Meteorological Org -https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/bulletin/observing-water-vapour    "Some atmospheric gases, such as water vapour and CO2, absorb and re-emit infrared energy from the atmosphere down to the Earth’s surface. This process, the greenhouse effect, leads to a mean surface temperature that is 33 °C greater than it would be in its absence. If it were not for the greenhouse gas effect, Earth’s average temperature would be a chilly -18 °C. However, it is the non-condensable or long-lived greenhouse gases – mainly CO2, but also methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and halocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs) – that act as the drivers of the greenhouse effect. Water vapour and clouds act as fast feedbacks – that is to say that water vapour responds rapidly to  ... <truncated>

Question about the concept of radiative forcing
As far as I understood, radiative forcing tells us how much something influences the energy balance of earth. So for example, a radiative forcing of 1,5 W/m^2 for CO2 tells us, that the added amount of CO2 changed earth energy balance in so far, that we now contain additional 1,5 W/m^2. Thus, we keep more energy in earths system causing warming. Please correct me, if I am wrong. I also have a question about radiative forcing in general: Relative to what time is radiative forcing usually given? Radiative forcing of CO2 for example depends on the added amount of CO2 added to earth's atmosphere but added since when?  And how is radiative forcing of CO2 or others factors measured?  And last: Why does CO2 have such high radiative forcing relative to other gases. It is something about the molecule or is it just the sheer amount we put into the atmosphere?

Greenhouse effect versus adiabatic lapse rate
Hi there,        I always had the intuition that the atmosphere would produce an insulating effect, even without the presence of greenhouse gases (GHGs).        I understand that, as a perfect blackbody radiator, the Earth's temperature can be calculated to be -18 degrees (assuming the 239W/m\^2 measured terrestrial output power is correct) via the Stefan Boltzmann equation, and that the absorption and re-emittance of terrestrial longform infrared radiation by GHGs creates an warming effect.        My question is, what other factors produce warming effects at the surface of the Earth, and what percentage of the total thermal increase can be ascribed to the presence of GHGs?        Someone told me that the adiabatic lapse rate has a heating effect, quote:        "As air rises, it expands and cools without exchanging heat with its surroundings. This establishes a vertical temperature gradient that retains heat near the surface, even in a hypothetical scenario with no GHGs. The adiabatic lapse rate, Γ, is governed by:        Γ = −g / c\_p        where g is the gravitational acceleration and c\_p is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure. This provides a baseline insulating effect independent of atmospheric composition, meaning Earth’s surface temperature would still be higher than 255 K even in the absence of GHGs."        Is this true? And, if so, is there a way to calculate the warming effect produced by the adiabatic lapse rate?

Re: mid 20th century cooling.
This came up a while ago.  I had to go digging to find it.    [https://history.aip.org/climate/aerosol.htm](https://history.aip.org/climate/aerosol.htm)    In short:  combination of mid century volcanoes, industrial and agricutural particulates, and smog.  Lot of argument among scientists as it wasn't clear whether aerosols warmed or cooled.  Wasn't well understood how aerosols interacted with radiation.  Some figured that the amount of aerosols ahd doubled in the last 50 years, and may double again in the next 50 and lead to a 3.5 cooling.      Flip side:  in 1971, a mars orbiter was able to measure tempertures during a martian dust storm, and caused the atomosphere to warm up.     There are 3 effects at play with an aerosol:      * It's reflection of sunlight back into space.  * Absorbtion of radiation by the particles warming the air around them.  * reflection of infra-red back to the earth    This process occurs in clouds too.    the far-infrared also occurs with air, especially with water vapour, CO2, and methane.

Cooling the planet
A question from a lay person when it comes to temperatures and atmospheric composition.    If we were able to dim the sun/solar input, and lower the temperature of earth back to what they were in, let's say 1980's.      Would that mean that we would have until 2024 to see these temperatures again? I assume it would be (much?) faster as we have a much higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.    Is a cooling project pointless unless we can also lower the concentration of GH gases?

How does CO2 dissipate energy?
Every article about the greenhouse effect says that after CO2 absorbs IR radiation, it emits it back out in a random direction, some to space, some back to earth.    Can CO2 undergo non-radiative vibrational relaxation through collisions and the transferring of kinetic energy to other atmospheric molecules? As described in a jablonski diagram? In a sense IR radiation is absorbed by GHG into kinetic energy, then transfers kinetic energy to other gases like O2 and N2 which cannot absorb IR radiation directly?    Please also share a link.

How do greenhouse gases absorb so much radiation when they're so rarely found?
I was hoping this forum could give me an intuitive explanation for this problem. I understand that about 90% of terrestrial radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases. I also understand that about 50% of terrestrial absorption is done by H2O, which leaves the other 50% to be done by CO2, O3, and CH4, which constitute, in combination, approximately only 0.04% of the atmosphere's mass (99% of that being CO2, which itself only accounts for 20% of absorption). How is it possible that only 0.04% of the atmosphere accounts for the absorption of 45% of terrestrial radiation?    I've read some answers along the lines of "Due to their triatomic structures, these molecules are able to change their symmetries and 'bend' and 'stretch' to absorb photons over a large range of wavelengths." This is quite unsatisfying, and not just because I am somewhat weak on the physics of what this means, but also because it doesn't do much to quell the intuition that light, being as small as it is, ought not to be able to be absorbed so consistently by something that is found in the atmosphere so rarely, regardless of its ability to "stretch and bend."    When I imagine this in my head, I sort of imagine it from the perspective of a photon, who sees the sky as a net through which it aims to transcend such that the concentration of GHGs corresponds with how large the holes in the net are. Hence, given a concentration of 0.04%, my intuition is that the rate at which photons encounter these gases on their way to space ought to be low, and certainly not 45%.    Just a disclaimer: I don't need reminding that human intuition did not evolve to account for the absorption properties of invisible molecules; I'm perfectly willing to accept my intuition is wrong! But I haven't been able to locate many sources online that really go into the physics of this phenomenon, let alone intuitively. So, if anyone could help with this, I would be very appreciative!

On what kind of timescale does surface longwave radiation get transferred to the atmosphere?
What are the temporal dynamics of heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere?     It seems pretty complicated to model because of how much it's affected by convection (e.g. wind) and evaporation. But, because gases (eg. air at approx. 0.025W/mK) are much less conductive than liquids (e.g. water at approx. 0.6W/mK) then it seems reasonable to predict ocean temperature slowly forces atmospheric temperature... but how slowly? How long would we expect increases in ocean temperature to translate to the atmosphere?

I'm still confused about the greenhouse effect
As far as I understand, the reason why the air is warmed is because CO2 that has absorbed a photon collides with other air molecules such as O2 and N2, transferring the thermal energy. The time span between absorption and emission of the photon is very short so that the CO2 needs to collide with another molecule within nanoseconds, otherwise it will emit the photon again. O2 and N2 cannot absorb infrared photons, so the air only gets warmed if CO2 absorbs and collides fast enough. However, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is very small (0.04%). So only a tiny fraction of the O2 and N2 molecules will ever collide with any CO2 molecules. My question is, how did this tiny change in CO2 concentration the past 100 years (0.01%) contribute to so much warming if the chance of O2 and N2 molecules colliding with CO2 is (both temporally and spatially) minuscule? I guess that this is hard to demonstrate in a reddit comment, so it would be great if you could link some papers that did these calculations.

Radiative forcing and Earth's Energy Imbalance
If I take Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI) now-ish (say 0.6 Watts/m2 around 2005) and subtract the radiative forcing relative to 1750 (say 2.6 W/m2 around 2005), I think this says the EEI in 1750 would have been about **minus two** W/m2: strongly cooling. There was cooling between 1000 and 1800 but this result does not seem right. Am I misunderstanding these concepts? Are they incomparable despite their definitions? Thanks.

CC- heat capacity
Atmospheric CO₂ is said to be the primary cause of climate change but nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂) make up about 99% of the earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, the increase in CO₂ over the last 100 years is approximately 0.02% where the atmospheric N₂ and O₂ is 5,000 times more abundant then the atmospheric CO₂.    The physics of climate change which you can skip, if you are not a scientist. The heat capacity represents the amount of heat that a gas can store (trap) heat which would be the cause of global warming based on the theory that CO₂ is trapping heat. Using thermodynamics, at 72 degree F, the molar heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) is 29.4 J/mol·K for nitrogen, 29.129 J/mol·K for oxygen and 37.1 J/mol·K for CO₂. In the last 100 years, the heat capacity of the earth's atmosphere has not significantly increased which proves CO₂ is not the primary cause of planetary greenhouse effect. Please do not cry if your feeling are hurt since this is well beyond anyone feelings.    The motion of the atmospheric CO₂ by wind and convection, is said to be creating climate change but atmospheric convection decreases the atmospheric temperature. Moreover, CO₂ is said to trap atmospheric heat but to trap heat requires a surface that cannot be formed by a gas, and as previously stated the heat capacity of CO₂ does not represent the heat that is being trapped by the atmosphere. Example, the mesh or glass of a greenhouse traps heat.    The real culprit of climate change is thermodynamic pollution being dumped into the environment. Salt water has the molar heat capacity of \~347.4 J/mol·K where the oceans traps six times more heat than the earth's atmosphere: consequently, once-through power plants are the primary cause of climate crises. Once-through power plants dumb their heated water directly into the water source that flows into the oceans or directly into the oceans. To solve climate change we need to know the real cause which is the responsibility of physicists since cl ... <truncated>

What's after the year 2020?
Up until the year 2019, every country around the globe was busy in their internal affairs, profit, and loss statements, agendas, propaganda, and more importantly proving their might in the world.  And then came the year which changes everything.    [2020, the year which changes everything.](https://preview.redd.it/7o9r4cwki7u61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ba5e721a954dc0da4219aaae3cb02ae2d3b50b3)    2020 started with the hint of global pandemic possibility which later on in March became a full-on global pandemic called COVID-19, every country across the globe got affected. Billions (still counting) of people got infected and millions (numbers still increasing) of people died. Billions of people across the world lost their jobs and businesses. World economy faced one of the worst setbacks in history.

World's biggest forest Amazon was burning and so is the Australian Outback. Many Asian countries were facing the worst floods in history and an increase in hurricanes and their frequencies . All in all 2020 was like a B-Grade Hollywood movie where the world is getting struck by one disaster after another nonstop; and the worst part is, it's still going on. And as per many experts around the world, "the worst is yet to come".

Should we continue to follow the same path we were following prior to the year 2020 or do we need to reconsider every single step from this moment onwards.

Saving and Empowering Earth: Restoring the Polar Vortex Over the Arctic Circle Methane Crisis
This goes against the established narrative but worth discussing and sharing openly to raise our awareness. Last year Siberia which is traditionally the coldest place on Earth was one of the hottest during winter and Texas experienced Arctic conditions. This is because of two linked factors; first the Arctic permafrost is melting rapidly releasing more methane then humans ever produced; then the polar vortex which was stable over the Arctic circle broke.    Currently this methane is being released from the land and water into the atmosphere worsening the greenhouse effect during summer. Winter the polar vortex broken ends of reaches into Texas because the permafrost is composing which causes heat. So the ground in the Arctic circle could be warm to the touch while America suffers Arctic conditions because the polar vortex is pushed away from its natural place. The Arctic also acted as a "cold sink" during the industrial revolution into now. Pollution went from hot to cold regions then became land locked in the permafrost; in addition to Methane the equivalent of three Olympic swimming pools of mercury is now being slowly released from the Arctic region globally.     Here is both a crisis that endangers the whole Earth and an opportunity to save it by addressing the issue. Arctic circle countries have the ability to power the entire world by capturing the Methane from the land and water before it's released into the atmosphere. Single piston cytogenetic coolers ran by Methane can be applied to the the Arctic circle and create an ice cap of supercooled ice to land lock mercury and methane being released. Strategic placement of supercooled ice towers among Arctic circle countries could eventually restore the polar vortex over the Arctic circle where it belongs.     Water pumped virtually during freezing temperatures is capable of creating ice towers 100ft yearly that gradually melt during summer. Cryogenic cores in ice towers would help ensure growth reducing melt and  ... <truncated>

There are LOADS of solution to climate change… So why aren’t they working?
I’m sure the regulars on this Reddit community realise that there are loads of solutions to climate change out there. Putting seeds in the ground seems like the simplest solution I’ve heard. I’ve been alive for decades and throughout my whole life people have been coming up with more and more complex solutions to climate change, but, the climate has consistently got worse.    Why?    It’s clear that these “solutions” don’t solve the root of the problem. I’m a game theorist, and it’s clear to me that the root of the problem is something very specific in economics:    Economists know we’re always closing in on equilibrium in trade. This causes all kinds of problems, like, mass waste, wealth divide, climate change. The bankers aren’t incentivised to fix their own problem as they are at the top end of the wealth divide, but they clearly don’t realise how to fix this either, as the solution is far more lucrative than any other business opportunity and it poses a massive risk to the bankers monopoly over our exchanges.    The bankers are stuck in their box, playing a game that’s destroying the world. This needs to be addressed sooner or later, and the sooner the better. It is relatively easy to address. And if the bankers don’t take the initiative, someone else will.

Time to revisit fracking gas for the UK.
We were fracking idiots to ignore the energy on our doorstep  Craven caution comes at a price and we are now paying it  MARK LITTLEWOOD  24 September 2021 • 3:00pm  The current energy crisis should come as no surprise. The market has been tampered with and taxed to such an extent that it can scarcely be called a market at all. Investing in energy supply has become unlike most normal financial decisions. The rate of return you can secure will depend not so much on the extent to which you have discovered some new innovatory process or a wizard way to improve productivity and efficiency. Instead, how the government choses to legislate and regulate the sector in the years to come is likely to be the key determinant of the money you make.  To the sort of mess we currently have in our inflexible energy market, it is usually an amalgamation of a series of factors and an aggregation of poor previous decision-making. Nowhere is this more obviously the case than in our total failure to embrace a fracking revolution and unleash the potential of shale gas.                    In the 25 years from 1980, the UK produced more energy than it needed, but since the turn of the century that has started to unravel – we now import more than third of our energy and about 60 per cent of our natural gas. This might not be so bad if we were genuinely sourcing cheap and efficient alternatives to homegrown energy. But it is a problem if we have instead squandered major opportunities in Britain.  A glance across the Atlantic gives a glimpse of what shale gas can achieve. Since 2005, the USA has gone from importing 15 per cent of their gas to being a net exporter. Household energy bills have fallen by around 40 per cent thanks to shale gas coming onstream. Other benefits have been enormous too – literally millions of jobs have been created and fracking has played a major role in America’s impressive 20 per cent reduction in energy-related emissions in the last 20 years.

Global methane crisis is actually a biggest opportunity to reduce fossil fuel dependency.
The Arctic has rapidly melted in recent years and in winter we've had periods where Texas was colder then Siberia; traditionally one of the coldest places on Earth. This thawing of the permafrost started a compositing process literally heating up the ground and producing large amounts of methane being released into the atmosphere; which is worse than CO2 in the greenhouse effect. The oceans at the equator are now near boiling during heat wave events. So that's a problem and a crisis publicly ignored for over a decade now.     Once upon a time during most older peoples alive today's lifetime; the "polar vortex" was a stable circle around the Arctic circle. Those extreme temperatures generally got colder more North someone was located. However due to the mass thaw of permafrost heating up the Arctic circle itself; this broke the polar vortex and the broken circle now reaches deep south of the United States yearly during winter. They did a study of a Arctic shelf in Siberia that was realising 100 to 1000 times more methane gas then humans have ever produced throughout history.     This raises the question what can be done that we aren't currently doing around the world. While this is a crisis that we can't ignore forever it's more of an opportunity if we endeavor to capture the methane from the land and water before it enters into our atmosphere; which one can assume change the oxygen quality and our health outcomes. If we do capture this methane then we'll genuinely have more to use for energy purposes then we'll know what to do with; have enough to without exaggeration supply the power needs for the entire Earth's population.     Oil and gas industies left to their devices will benefit from the heating up of what was permafrost and may accelerate the process without concern for the immediate global scale implications. There's many countries who are part of the Arctic circle but conflict among nations persist. Besides capturing the methane to supply the global energy  ... <truncated>

What Will Happen To The Environment With The Covid Crisis?
What will be the consequences of the Coronavirus crisis on the environment?    We're seeing shallow eco-friendly trends during the lockdowns (the production stops so pollution goes down), but it's pretty clear that these are only temporary.     The real problem is that together with industrial production the environmental diplomacy, so precious for real changes towards a greener economy, has paused too, and I'm afraid that the eco-friendly outburst we were seeing in the past one-two years with Greta Thunberg and the Green New Deal is fading out because of the pandemic.

Are negative climate outcomes aggregative or emergent outcomes?
Hey everyone,        I've been trying to figure out the following question and would love to be pointed towards some reading should you know any.        I was wondering whether negative climate outcomes (such as floods, hurricanes, sea-level rise, etc) are aggregative or emergent. By aggregative I mean the sense in which mass is aggregative: One stone has a certain mass, and a pile of stones has the sum of all these masses. By emergent I mean something like sliminess: A droplet of oil has a certain sliminess, but each constituent molecule does not have sliminess at all - i.e. are non-slimy, though the whole is slimy (i.e. the whole has a property that none of its parts has).        Now, is climate change like mass (in that every bit of greenhouse gasses has a small and proportionate chance of bringing out a negative climate outcome) or like sliminess (in that we don't really know how an additional emission will impact the climate outcomes, as it all comes down to the order and position of these particles).         If you know of any paper that would touch on this, I'd love to read it. Thanks in advance!

With respect to the budget and deadline, the British Embassy declared that its maximum budget limit was RON48,571 (£8,951) and the project’s activities should be completed by 15th March 2021.    The Embassy specified that it was open to promote environmentally conscious projects like clean growth, green finance and nature-based solutions to help adaptation, build resilience and support efforts to raise public awareness about climate change. It emphasised that a project should be able to reflect the impact of climate change on economy and society. It highlighted that the focus of the program was to explore renewable energy, restore natural habitats and ecosystems and prepare communities for natural disasters.    It added that the project proposals should contain a clear outline of its targets and should be able to measure its results, through events, reports, response and impact.
